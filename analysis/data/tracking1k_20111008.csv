We present nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data describing the ternary system composed of the bile acid binding protein, bile acids, and membrane mimetic systems, such as anionic liposomes. This work provides evidence that the investigated liver bile acid binding protein undergoes association with the anionic membrane and binding-induced partial unfolding. The addition of the physiological ligand to the protein-liposome mixture is capable of modulating this interaction, shifting the equilibrium towards the free folded holo protein. An ensemble of NMR titration experiments, based on nitrogen-15 protein and ligand observation, confirm that the membrane and the ligand establish competing binding equilibria, modulating the cytoplasmic permeability of bile acids. These results support a mechanism of ligand binding and release controlled by the onset of a bile salt concentration gradient within the polarized cell.

By using the main physiolog- ical rates of foraminifers (nutrition, respiration, symbiotic photosynthesis), this model estimates their growth as a function of temperature, light availability, and food concen- tration. Model parameters are directly derived or calibrated from experimental obser- vations and only the influence of food concentration (estimated via chl-a concentration) 10 was calibrated against field observations. Growth rates estimated from the model show positive correlation with observed abundance from plankton net data suggesting close coupling between individual and assemblage growth rates. This observation was used to directly estimate potential abundance from the model-derived growth. Using satel- lite data, the model simulate the dominant foraminifer with a 70.5\% efficiency when compared to a data set of 576 field observations worldwide. Using outputs of a bio- geochemical model of the global ocean (PISCES) instead of satellite images as forcing variables gives also good results, but with lower efficiency (58.9\%). The model also correctly reproduces the relative worldwide abundance and the diversity of the eight species when compared to core tops observations both using satellite and PISCES 20 data. This model allows prediction of the season and water depth at which each species has its highest growth potential.

Variability in space and time of the size of the most abundant species (Fragilariopsis kerguelensis) may directly impact the way this ecosystem functions, and also affect the nutrient balance of the global ocean, as important water masses (e.g. the Antarctic Intermediate Water) get their nutrient signature in this area. We used a biometric approach and analyzed the size variability of F kerguelensis valves in sixty-four surface sediment samples from the Southern Ocean, in sediment trap samples from a mooring (Site PF3) at the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), and along a nearby piston core (PS1654-2). The average length and valve area of F. kerguelensis displayed a distinct increase in the proximity of the APF, and lower values to the north and south of it, and also changed markedly over seasonal cycles, as diatom blooms and nutrient availability waxe and wane. The last glacial to interglacial transition also witnesses important changes in the general shape and valve size of F. kerguelensis, with specimens from glacial intervals being ca. 30\% larger than their interglacial counterparts (195 versus 150 mu m(2) valve area). A sharp peak in average area and a very specific valve morphology correspond to the first signs of deglaciation and concurring SST (Sea Surface Temperature) increase and sea-ice retreat. The latter, together with melting icebergs, may have contributed dissolved iron to surface waters. The highest average sizes during glacial intervals are higher than what found anywhere in the Southern Ocean today. The newly proposed proxy (valve area and shape of F. kerguelensis) may thus prove useful for the reconstruction of the past position and nutrient characteristics of the APF and ""opal belt"", a region characterized by high production and export of biogenic silica, in a particularly sensitive and dynamic area such as the Southern Ocean.

Carbonate patterns in most places reveal a decline in biogenic carbonate preservation during glacial periods, mainly attributed to a reduced influx of North Atlantic Deep Water and increased ocean stratification, which modified deep-water chemistry towards more corrosivity. An important lithological feature of the Southern Ocean is the Circumpolar Opal Belt, which today is situated between the Polar Front and the seasonal sea-ice limit to the south. During the glacial periods the opal belt shifted to the north in response to a wider sea-ice extension that reduced light availability and diatom productivity to the south. Biosiliceous productivity to the north likely was fueled by detrital iron supplied by aeolian dust input and/or hemipelagic processes. Lithogenic fluxes generally increased during the glacial periods. Provenance studies on the origin and dispersal of detrital materials suggest combined effects of low sea-level stands, increased glaciogenic input, and enhanced current transport to have caused elevated detrital fluxes. The relative and absolute contribution of aeolian dust is difficult to decipher and awaits further clarification by integrated provenance studies of both marine sediments and more reference materials from the potential terrestrial source areas. Ice-rafted debris (IRD) represents a minor fraction of lithogenic sediments, but can be used to infer both Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics and the fate of both sea-ice and iceberg survival in the distal Southern Ocean. Future work should be concentrated on a better identification of IRD origin in terms of volcaniclastic influences, the distinction of east and west Antarctic sediment sources, and sea-ice versus iceberg transportation.

On a latitudinal transect along 120 degrees W, diatom valve accumulation rates (AR) reach maximum values (8-10 x 10(8) valves m(-2) yr(-1)) in a zone extending over ca. 900 km between the Antarctic Polar Front and the maximum average winter sea ice extent and exceed those ARs obtained from an eastern transect along 90 degrees W by one order of magnitude. Lowest diatom concentrations (1-3 x 10(6) valves g(-1)) were encountered in sediments of the Sea Ice Zone, affected by winter and summer sea ice. The accumulation rate pattern of the most abundant diatom Fragilariopsis kerguelensis (>50\% abundance in 47 samples) mirrors the pattern of the total diatom valve AR and the biogenic silica (BSi) AR, making F. kerguelensis the major contributor to the BSi preserved at the sea floor. Relative abundances of diatom species and species groups were statistically compared with a selection of environmental variables, such as the mean summer sea surface temperature and salinity, mean annual surface nutrient concentration (nitrate, phosphate, silicon), mean annual water column stratification, mixed layer depth in summer, and mean summer and winter sea ice concentrations. Polynomial canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed the biogeographic distribution of diatom species had the strongest relationship with summer sea surface temperature (SSST) out of the nine tested environmental variables. This relationship accounted for 69.6\% of the total variance of the diatom distribution, with 29.7\% explained by the first gradient (significantly correlated to SSST with r(2) = 0.941) and 15.6\% explained by the second gradient (correlated to both summer and winter sea ice and silicon concentration). Azpeitia tabularis, Hemidiscus cuneiformis and Roperia tesselata were associated with warmer water conditions (>4 degrees C), whereas Fragilariopsis curta, F. separanda, F. rhombica and Thalassiosira gracilis were correlated with cold SSST (<1.5 degrees C). Under the second gradient relationship, Actinocyclus actinochilus and F. curta were the most important diatoms representative of the diatom distribution in relation to the observed mean summer and winter sea ice concentrations. Confirming these environmental relationships is crucial for the development of reference data sets used in quantitative estimations of palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions with statistical methods. This new data set represents the first modernised treatment of diatom remains from the SE Pacific Ocean and generally supports the use of a circum-polar database for the determination of summer SST, sea ice and potentially biogenic silica distribution of the Southern Ocean back into the Late Quaternary.

Project data management is done since 1996. 2001 the ICSUWorld Data Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (WDC-MARE) was founded and since 2003 â€“ together with other German WDC â€“ the group was working on the development of data publications as a new publication type. To achieve interoperability with other data centers and portals the system was adapted to global information standards. PANGAEAR î€ç has implemented a number of community specific data portals. 2007 â€“ under the coordination of the PANGAEAR î€ç group â€“ an initiative for networking all WDC was started.

The Li/Ca record is corrected for interspecific offsets determined from recent (Holocene) foraminifera; interspecific offsets in delta Li-7 are not significant. Despite different diagenetic histories, the records produced from both oceans are remarkably consistent. Corrected planktonic foraminiferal Li/Ca ratios range from 6.3 to 10.9 mu mol/mol, while planktonic foraminiferal delta Li-7 ranges from 25 to 31 parts per thousand. Both records are interpreted in terms of long-term changes in seawater Li/Ca and delta Li-7, enabling issues related to higher-resolution variability in Li/Ca and delta Li-7 to be ignored. By assuming that the hydrothermal flux of Li into the oceans, and the flux of Li removed from the oceans during low-temperature uptake by marine basalts and sediments, have not changed significantly since 18 Ma, and using published records for the seawater calcium concentration, the seawater Li/Ca and delta Li-7 records can be used to estimate global average river delta Li-7 and Li fluxes. Our records indicate that the river flux of dissolved Li decreased between 16 and similar to 8 Ma while the delta Li-7 value of the river input increased. These data imply that both silicate weathering rates and weathering intensity decreased over this interval which may have been responsible for putative increases in levels of atmospheric CO2. In contrast, the riverine flux of Li has increased since similar to 8 Ma while its delta Li-7 value has increased. This implies that the silicate weathering rate has increased, white weathering intensity has decreased, since that time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, the detailed sequence of events that leads to a glacial termination remains controversial. It is particularly unclear whether the northern(2,3) or southern(4-6) hemisphere leads the termination. Here we present a hypothesis for the beginning and continuation of glacial terminations, which relies on the observation that the initial stages of terminations are indistinguishable from the warming stage of events in Antarctica known as Antarctic Isotopic Maxima(7), which occur frequently during glacial periods. Such warmings in Antarctica generally begin to reverse with the onset of a warm Dansgaard-Oeschger event in the northern hemisphere(7,8). However, in the early stages of a termination, Antarctic warming is not followed by any abrupt warming in the north. We propose that the lack of an Antarctic climate reversal enables southern warming and the associated atmospheric carbon dioxide rise to reach a point at which full deglaciation becomes inevitable. In our view, glacial terminations, in common with other warmings that do not lead to termination, are led from the southern hemisphere, but only specific conditions in the northern hemisphere enable the climate state to complete its shift to interglacial conditions.","[Wolff, E.

With continents basically in their current positions and atmospheric CO2 similar to early twenty-first century values, the cause of Mid-Pliocene warmth remains elusive. Understanding the behaviour of the North Atlantic Ocean during the Mid-Pliocene is integral to evaluating future climate scenarios owing to its role in deep water formation and its sensitivity to climate change. Under the framework of the Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) sea surface reconstruction, we synthesize Mid-Pliocene North Atlantic studies by PRISM members and others, describing each region of the North Atlantic in terms of palaeoceanography. We then relate Mid-Pliocene sea surface conditions to expectations of future warming.

As the reduction in the amplitude of climate and greenhouse gases concentration variations before 400 ka BP is present in both deep-sea and ice cores, it is tempting to conclude that this is a worldwide phenomenon. This is not necessarily true, at least as far as some of the records, in particular of China and Europe, are concerned. The loess in northern China, the sedimentary core in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the palaeosols in southern China all record an unusually warm and wet climate during Marine Isotope Stage 13, indicating an extremely strong East Asian summer monsoon.

Major and trace-element data on these tephras delineate eight distinct groups. The geochemical data and multivariate statistics allow the correlation of the tephra layers with six previously described marine tephras from the eastern Mediterranean Sea; potential terrestrial sources are suggested for the others. The chronostratigraphy of the tephra layers was established using several radiocarbon dates and the oxygen isotope stratigraphy from two long piston cores. Four widespread tephra layers occur within the upper Quaternary sediments of the Aegean Sea. The two youngest widespread tephra layers were derived from the Santorini volcano of south-central Aegean Sea: Z2 (the Minoan eruption, ca. 3.6 ka) and Y2 (the Cape Riva eruption, ca. 21.7 ka). The Y2 tephra is also identified in three piston cores from the Marmara Sea, The two older widespread tephra layers originated from the eruptions which emplaced the Campanian Ignimbrite of the Italian Volcanic Provinces (i.e., the Y5 tephra, ca. 39.3 ka) and from the Nisyros volcano of the southeastern Aegean Sea. The consistent occurrence of the Nisyros tephra below the Y5 tephra confirms similar findings in a lake core on the Island of Lesbos. Linear extrapolations using the oxygen isotope stratigraphy suggest an age of 42-44 ka for the Nisyros eruption. Three additional tephra layers with a limited regional distribution are identified in the Aegean Sea cores. Two of these tephras originated from the Yali volcano of the southeastern Aegean Sea and from the Aeolian Islands (i.e., X1 tephra).

As the westerlies control directly oceanic fronts, the movement of the subtropical front (STF) reflects the westerlies migration. Thus it is important to understand the relationships between STF movement and the weaterlies, ventilation of the deep SO, ice volume and atmospheric CO2. To this end, we use two new high-resolution records from early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 20 (similar to 800 ka) of sea surface temperature (SST) based on U (37) (k') paleo-thermometer and benthic oxygen isotope (delta O-18(B)) at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1170B in the southern Tasman Sea (STS), to construct linkages between the marine records and atmospheric proxies from Antarctic ice-cores. During the last 800 ka, the average SST (10.2A degrees C) at Site 1170B is 1.8A degrees C lower than today (annual average 12A degrees C). The highest average SST of 11.6A degrees C occurred during MIS 1, and the lowest average SST of 7.8A degrees C occurred during MIS 2. The warmest and coldest records of 14.7A degrees C and 6.2A degrees C occurred in the MIS 5 and MIS 2, respectively. In the glacial-interglacial cycles of the last 800 ka, variability of reconstructed SST shows that the STF moved northward or southward more than 3A degrees of latitude compared with its present location. In the warmest stage MIS 5, the STF shifted to its southernmost location of similar to 49A degrees S. In contrast, in the coldest stage MIS 2, the STF moved to its northernmost location of similar to 43A degrees S. In response to orbital cycles, the westerlies movement led ice volume and atmospheric CO2 changes, but it was in phase with change in Antarctic atmospheric temperature. Ice volume only preceded atmospheric CO2 only a little at the 23-ka precession band, lagged the atmospheric CO2 at the 100-ka eccentricity band, and was in phase with atmospheric CO2 at the 40-ka obliquity band.","[Li WenBao; Wang RuJian; Xiang Fei; Ding XiaoHui] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Zhao MeiXun] Ocean Univ China, Inst Marine Organ Geochem, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; BEIJING; 16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST,","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

Here we focus on the tropical marine record, presenting alkenone-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity records from the eastern equatorial Atlantic, eastern equatorial Pacific, the Arabian Sea, and the South China Sea for a time interval covering the heart of the 41 kyr world (1.2 - 2.0 Ma). All four SST records are dominated by variance in the obliquity band, suggesting that high-latitude dynamics and low-latitude climate were tightly coupled in the 41 kyr world, despite smaller ice volume variability during this interval as compared to the late Pleistocene. At the 41 kyr period, SST varied coherently and nearly synchronously between the four study regions, suggesting a tropic-wide feedback to high- latitude processes. Productivity variations at our equatorial Atlantic and Pacific sites were also coherent in the obliquity band, implying tropical trade wind variability at this frequency during the early Pleistocene. In contrast, we observe heterogeneous SST and productivity responses in the precession band between each of the tropical locations. Local atmospheric circulation patterns, rather than a globally coordinated response to precessional insolation forcing, apparently determined SSTs and productivity in the tropics at precessional frequencies during the early Pleistocene.","Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

The core top TEX86-derived temperature is the same as the present-day summer sea surface temperature (SST), suggesting that TEX86 records seasonal rather than annually averaged SSTs in this region. The TEX86 record reveals similar to 3 degrees C lower summer SST during glacial maxima than during interglacial periods and significant warming during the deglaciations (15-10 ka and 136-130 ka). This is consistent with previous inferences of more expanded and persistent seasonal sea ice during the glacial periods than the present-day and its substantial retreat during the deglaciation. Timing of the deglacial warming also coincided with a distinct increase in coccolithophorid productivity, suggesting a causal relationship between sea surface warming and coccolithophorid blooms during the deglaciations. The relationship could reflect an increase in the supply of fresh and warm water from the Amur River during deglaciation, which significantly impacted hydrology by facilitating sea surface stratification, which in turn promoted production of coccolithophids.","[Seki, Osamu; Pancost, Richard D.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Organ Geochem Unit, Bristol Biogeochem Res Ctr, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [Sakamoto, Tatsuhiko; Sakai, Saburo] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci \& Technol, Inst Res Earth Evolut, Yokosuka, Kanagaw","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

Our results indicate that development of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet is paralleled by an overall amplification of both deterministic and stochastic climate energy, but their relative dominance is variable. The progression from a more stochastic early Pliocene to a strongly deterministic late Pleistocene is primarily accommodated during two transitory phases of Northern Hemisphere ice sheet growth. This long-term trend is punctuated by ""stochastic events,"" which we interpret as evidence for abrupt reorganization of the climate system at the initiation and termination of the mid-Pleistocene transition and at the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. In addition to highlighting a complex interplay between deterministic and stochastic climate change during the Plio-Pleistocene, our results support an early onset for Northern Hemisphere glaciation (between 3.5 and 3.7 Ma) and reveal some new characteristics of the orbital signal response, such as the puzzling emergence of 100 ka and 400 ka cyclic climate variability during theoretical eccentricity nodes.","[Meyers, Stephen R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hinnov, Linda A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Morton K Blaustein Dept Earth \& Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

Here we use the distinctive phasing between seasurface temperatures and the oxygen-isotope records of benthic foraminifera in the southeast Atlantic Ocean to stratigraphically align the Holocene interglacial with the first half of the Marine Isotope Stage 11 interglacial optimum. This alignment suggests that the second half of Marine Isotope Stage 11 should not be used as a reference for 'pre-anthropogenic' greenhouse-gas emissions. By compiling benthic carbon-isotope records from sites in the Atlantic Ocean on a single timescale, we also find that meridional overturning circulation strengthened about 415,000 years ago, at a time of high orbital obliquity.

Its 20 degrees latitudinal extent includes a complex of submerged plateaux, ridges, saddles and basins which, in the present interglacial, are partial barriers to circulation and steer the Subtropical (STF) and Subantarctic (SAF) fronts. This configuration offers a singular opportunity to assess the influence of bottom topography on oceanic circulation through Pleistocene glacial interglacial (G/I) cycles, its effect on the location and strength of the fronts, and its ability to generate significant differences in mixed layer thermal history over short distances. For this study we use new planktic foraminiferal based sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates spanning the past 1 million years from a latitudinal transect of four deep ocean drilling sites. We conclude that: 1. the effect of the New Zealand landmass was to deflect the water masses south around the bathymetric impediments: 2. the effect of a shallow submerged ridge on the down-current side (Chatham Rise), was to dynamically trap the STF along its crest, in stark contrast to the usual glacial-interglacial (G-I) mericlional migration that occurs in the open ocean; 3. the effect of more deeply submerged, downstream plateaux (Campbell, Bounty) was to dynamically trap the SAF along its steep southeastern margin; 4. the effects of saddles across the submarine plateaux was to facilitate the development of jets of subtropical and subantarctic surface water through the fronts, forming localized downstream gyres or eddies during different phases in the G-I climate cycles; 5. the deep Pukaki Saddle across the Campbell-Bounty Plateaux guided a branch of the SAF to flow northwards during each glacial, to form a strong gyre of circumpolar surface water in the Bounty Trough, especially during the mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MIS 22-16) when exceptionally high SST gradients existed across the STF; 6. the shallower Mernoo Saddle, at the western end of the Chatham Rise, provided a conduit for subtropical water to jet southwards across the STF in the warmest interglacial peaks (MIS 11, 5.5) and for subantarctic water to flow northwards during glacials; 7. although subtropical or subantarctic drivers can prevail at a particular phase of a G-I cycles, it appears that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the main influence on the regional hydrography. Thus complex submarine topography can affect distinct differences in the climate records over short distances with implications for using such records in interpreting global or regional trends. Conversely, the local topography can amplify the paleoclimate record in different ways in different places, thus enhancing its value for the study of more minor paleoceanographic influences that elsewhere are more difficult to detect. Such sites include DSDP 594, which like some other Southern Ocean sites, has the typical late Pleistocene asymmetrical saw-tooth G-I climate pattern transformed to a gap-tooth pattern of quasi-symmetrical interglacial spikes that interrupt extended periods of minimum glacial temperatures.

The high-resolution data sets (X-ray fluorescence, total organic carbon, and C-37 alkenones) were used to track changes in paleoproductivity, freshwater budget, and sea surface temperature (SST) of the tropical climate system at orbital time scales over the past 300 ka. Our paleoclimatic data show that enhanced marine paleoproductivity was directly related to strengthening of coastal upwelling during periods of increased boreal summer insolation and associated SE monsoon strength with a precessional cyclicity. Changes in freshwater supply were primarily forced by precession-controlled changes in boreal NW winter monsoon rainfall enclosing an additional sea level component.

However, the same investigations also identified the largest climatic cycle as being about 100 kyr long. As the 100-kyr variations in standing insolation due to eccentricity change are too small, they cannot be the direct cause of the ice ages. This is the reason why most of the modeling studies attempting to explain the relation between the astronomical forcing and climatic change have focused on this 100-kyr cycle. In this paper, we will show the astronomical origin of the periods at about 100 kyr that characterize the long-term variations of eccentricity, of its first derivative, of the frequency modulation of obliquity, and of the inclination of the Earth's orbit on the invariable plane of reference. Five independent values are found between 95 and 107 kyr, and a wavelet signature is suggested to test the possible relationships between the astronomical and climatic variables.

The elastic sediments can be divided into units based on the presence of intercalated flowstones, forming flowstone bounded units (FBU). Ten MC-ICP-MS uranium-series dates on several flowstone horizons in the Gladysvale Internal Deposit fan indicate deposition from the late mid-Pleistocene (similar to 570 ka) to Holocene (similar to 7 ka) during limited periods of higher effective moisture. Clastic sedimentation occurred during the interceding, presumably more arid, periods. This sequence is not consistent with earlier models for South African caves that simply assumed interglacial sedimentation and glacial erosion. C-13/C-12 data suggest that flowstone tended to form during periods with higher proportions of C-3 plants in the local vegetation, while elastic sediments reflect higher proportions Of C-4 grasses, although this is not always the case. We argue that flowstones are precipitated during periods of higher effective precipitation and restricted cave entrances, while elastic sediments accumulated during periods with more open vegetation. The sedimentary fill of the fossiliferous deposits are, therefore, highly episodic in nature, with large periods of time unlikely to be represented. This has serious implications for the other hominin-bearing caves close by, as these deposits are likely to be similarly episodic. This is especially pertinent when addressing extinction events and reconstructions of paleoenvironments, as large periods of time may be unrecorded. The Gladysvale Cave fill sediments may serve as a climatically forced chronostratigraphic model for these less well-stratified and well-dated Plio-Pleistocene sites. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We improved the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic APWP by analyzing a large, diverse paleomagnetic data set that combines core sample, seamount magnetic anomaly model, and marine magnetic anomaly skewness data. Our preferred APWP has five mean paleomagnetic poles representing the Oligocene (30 Ma), Late (39 Ma) and Early (49 Ma) Eocene, and Palcocene (61 Ma) epochs and the Maastrichtian (68 Ma) stage. Along with a published 80 Ma pole, the APWP shows a stillstand from similar to 80 to similar to 49 Ma punctuating the large overall northward drift of the plate. The two youngest poles imply resumption of northward motion during mid-Eocene time with another change of polar motion after similar to 30 Ma. If unaffected by other phenomena (e.g., true polar wander or change in time-averaged magnetic field geometry), the stillstand implies negligible northward plate motion during the period of Emperor Seamounts formation, contrary to most accepted plate motion models. The stillstand is consistent with paleomagnetic data from the Emperor Seamounts, which imply southward motion of the Hawaiian melting anomaly. It also implies significant westward drift of the hotspot if the Pacific plate was moving west at rates similar to the later Cenozoic. In addition, changes in polar wander after similar to 49 Ma are consistent with changes of north Pacific plate boundaries.

We here use various paleo-climatic records from the EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice core and from oceanic sediment cores covering the last 740 kyr to force the ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box model of the global carbon cycle BICYCLE in a forward mode over this time in order to interpret the natural variability of CO2. Our approach is based on the previous interpretation of carbon cycle variations during Termination I (Kohler et al., 2005a). In the absense of a process-based sediment module one main simplification of BICYCLE is that carbonate compensation is approximated by the temporally delayed restoration of deep ocean [CO32-]. Our results match the low frequency changes in CO2 measured in the Vostok and the EPICA Dome C ice core for the last 650 kyr BP (r(2)approximate to 0.75). During these transient simulations the carbon cycle reaches never a steady state due to the ongoing variability of the overall carbon budget caused by the time delayed response of the carbonate compensation to other processes. The average contributions of different processes to the rise in CO2 during Terminations I to V and during earlier terminations are: the rise in Southern Ocean vertical mixing: 36/22 ppmv, the rise in ocean temperature: 26/11 ppmv, iron limitation of the marine biota in the Southern Ocean: 20/14 ppmv, carbonate compensation: 15/7 ppmv, the rise in North Atlantic deep water formation: 13/0 ppmv, the rise in gas exchange due to a decreasing sea ice cover: -8/-7 ppmv, sea level rise: -12/-4 ppmv, and rising terrestrial carbon storage: -13/-6 ppmv. According to our model the smaller interglacial CO2 values in the pre-Vostok period prior to Termination V are mainly caused by smaller interglacial Southern Ocean SST and an Atlantic THC which stayed before MIS 11 (before 420 kyr BP) in its weaker glacial circulation mode.","Alfred Wegener Inst Polar \& Marine Res, Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; KATLENBURG-LINDAU; MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, 37191 KATLENBURG-LINDAU, GERMANY","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.712938; data\_collection\_article:Marchitto, Thomas M; Lynch-Stieglitz, Jean; Hemming, Sidney R (2005): Deep Pacific CaCO3 compensation and glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2.

Coccolithophores have the potential to respond to parameters of orbital forcing other than insolation, and, as a critical component of the ocean carbon cycle, can act to modify the climate response. The first-direct comparison of coccolith fraction Sr/Ca, alkenone abundance and automated coccolithophore counts, shows that CF Sr/Ca is largely driven by changing production of bloom species, with unusually high Sr/Ca ratios. The periods of high CF Sr/Ca and high bloom production mark periods of high global coccolithophore production, which correlate inversely with the low amplitude 100 and higher amplitude 400 k.y. eccentricity orbital frequency similar to 400 k.y. cycles of coccolithophore bloom production correspond to periods of enhanced carbonate accumulation in some parts of the ocean, deep ocean dissolution in others, positive shifts in global ocean delta C-13, and acmes of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica and Emiliania huxleyi. The link between production of coccolithophore blooms and eccentricity may be due to orbital control of silica leakage from the Southern Ocean, to the orbitally defined inverse correlation between insolation and growing season length and the asymptotic growth response to these parameters, or to changes in nutrient input from weathering. During the Pleistocene, the eccentricity induced coccolithophore acmes have no apparent influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) due to the shift towards small bloom coccolithophores, or to coupling with increased diatom productivity, or the ballast effect of the calcium carbonate rain, such that Pleistocene climate has no significant variance at the largest amplitude eccentricity forcing of 400 k.y. Coccolithophores and their influence on the carbon cycle may act as a filter between the incident orbital forcing and resultant climate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These SST records suggest that average equatorial Pacific SSTs remained thermally stable from 5 to 2 Ma, after which significant cooling occurred only in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This study examines the implications of adjusting available equatorial Pacific SST records based on Mg/Ca paleothermometry to account for the inferred past variations of seawater Mg/Ca.

This is because while the basic mechanism of greenhouse-gas forcing of climate is well understood, the multiple, mostly positive, feedback loops that amplify this effect are not. The combined effect of many of these feedbacks can be seen in the record of past climate, and analysis of these suggests that our present models tend to under-predict the eventual, equilibrium climate change due to a given increase in atmospheric CO2. In the foreseeable future (next 20 years) climate modelling research will probably not materially decrease the uncertainty on predictions for the climate of 2100. The uncertainty will only start to decrease as we actually observe what happens to the climate. The best use of climate models at present is via ensembles of predictions that give a probabilistic description of the range of uncertainty involved in future climate. Recent studies suggest a skewed probability distribution, with a tail stretching out to high climate sensitivities. Combined with estimates of the likely economic impact of climate change, this strongly suggests that research should be concentrated on trying to reduce the uncertainty represented by this tail of low probability, but high impact, scenarios.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; NEW YORK; 233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

Yet concomitant records of sea-level fluctuations-needed to reveal rates and magnitudes of ice-volume change that provide context to projections for the future(3-9)-remain elusive. Reconstructions indicate fast rates of sea-level rise up to 5 cm yr(-1) during glacial terminations(10), and 1-2 cm yr(-1) during interglacials(11,12) and within the past glacial cycle(13). However, little is known about the total long-term sea-level rise in equilibration to warming. Here we present a sea-level record for the past 520,000 years based on stable oxygen isotope analyses of planktonic foraminifera and bulk sediments from the Red Sea. Our record reveals a strong correlation on multi-millennial timescales between global sea level and Antarctic temperature(1), which is related to global temperature(6,7). On the basis of this correlation, we estimate sea level for the Middle Pliocene epoch (3.0-3.5 Myr ago)-a period with near-modern CO2 levels-at 25 +/- 5 m above present, which is validated by independent sea-level data(6,14-16).

The results show a broad coupling between Asian and Antarctic climates at the glacial-interglacial scale. However, a number of decoupled aspects are revealed, among which marine isotope stage (MIS) 13 exhibits a strong anomaly compared with the other interglacials. It is characterized by unusually positive benthic oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon isotope (delta C-13) values in the world oceans, cooler Antarctic temperature, lower summer sea surface temperature in the South Atlantic, lower CO2 and CH4 concentrations, but by extremely strong Asian, Indian and African summer monsoons, weakest Asian winter monsoon, and lowest Asian dust and iron fluxes. Pervasive warm conditions were also evidenced by the records from northern high-latitude regions. These consistently indicate a warmer Northern Hemisphere and a cooler Southern Hemisphere, and hence a strong asymmetry of hemispheric climates during MIS-13. Similar anomalies of lesser extents also occurred during MIS-11 and MIS-5e. Thus, MIS-13 provides a case that the Northern Hemisphere experienced a substantial warming under relatively low concentrations of greenhouse gases. It suggests that the global climate system possesses a natural variability that is not predictable from the simple response of northern summer insolation and atmospheric CO2 changes. During MIS-13, both hemispheres responded in different ways leading to anomalous continental, marine and atmospheric conditions at the global scale. The correlations also suggest that the marine delta O-18 record is not always a reliable indicator of the northern ice-volume changes, and that the asymmetry of hemispheric climates is one of the prominent factors control-ling the strength of Asian, Indian and African monsoon circulations, most likely through modulating the position of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and land-sea thermal contrasts.","[Guo, Z.

Thick sequences of laminated silts, alternating with transgressive sands and deltaic gravels, attest to a long history of climatically controlled lake level variations. The post-glacial rise in lake level began sometime after 16.3 ka, reached stable levels first at 14.5 +/- 0.6 ka and then rose again after ca. 14.3 ka. A significant lake level regression spanned the interval from 12.6 +/- 0.3 to 11.6 +/- 0.5 ka, synchronous with the Younger Dryas. Deep lake conditions were reestablished after ca. 11ka, at which time the lake overtopped the crater. Overflow continued until 8.8 +/- 0.5 ka, when another significant but short-lived regression occurred. Deep, but probably not overflowing conditions were again reestablished by > 7.2 +/- 0.3 ka and continued until around 3.2 +/- 0.1 ka. when lake level dropped precipitously. Multicentury late Holocene highstands occurred at 2.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 ka, although these were significantly lower than those registered in the late glacial and early Holocene. The timing of late glacial events is similar to those recorded elsewhere in Africa and the higher latitudes, and likely reflects the dominant control of high latitude northern hemisphere conditions on the African tropics during the times of large northern hemisphere ice sheets. Mid- to late-Holocene variations appear to be less coupled with changes across Africa and elsewhere, suggesting that regional forcing may be more important during warmer periods.

Independent chronological control was obtained by AMS radiocarbon dating of organic sediments in the upper part of the sequence and OSL dating of inorganic silts in the lower part, with a unique tie point provided by the ca 26.5 cal ka Kawakawa Tephra. As was probably a common occurrence in this region, the basin developed as a moraine-dammed proglacial lake and remained lacustrine until the early Holocene, when a peat bog developed. Survival of the depositional site through subsequent multiple ice advances, unusual in a glaciated landscape, was probably assisted by lateral displacement of the basin relative to its source area, across the Alpine Fault. There is good correspondence between inferred periods of substantial treeline depression in the pollen profile and the record for ice advance in this region. More cooling events are evident in the pollen record, however, presumably due to the fragmentary nature of glacial geomorphology. The pollen record also shows broad consistency with the MIS record and hence with the Milankovitch orbital forcing model, but with some departures, including an early onset to the last glacial maximum (LGM). Several sub-Milankovitch scale events are also evident, including a mid-LGM warming and Lateglacial reversals during both the last and the penultimate deglaciation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the North Atlantic, the revised LGM MARGO data set provides a comprehensive coverage, including the Nordic Seas. The data set includes reconstruction based on planktonic foraminifer assemblages, dinocyst assemblages, alkenone coccolithophorid biomarkers and Mg/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifers. Several hydrological features of the LGM North Atlantic can be identified, that are supported by all four proxies. They include an extensive perennial sea-ice cover along the eastern Canadian and Greenland margins, seasonally ice-free central North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea, and the winter sea-ice limit being located at about 55 degrees N. All proxies also suggest significantly colder than modern sea-surface conditions in the southeastern part of the North Atlantic and a more zonal temperature pattern than at present, with a steep SST gradient of the order of 10 degrees C between 40 degrees N and 45 degrees N. However, in the Nordic Seas large discrepancies remain, well above the level of uncertainty of the SST reconstructions. These discrepancies might be related to stratification of the upper water mass linked to large annual amplitude of temperature with contrasting winter and summer conditions, high interannual-interdecadal variability, or taphonomic processes affecting some of the proxies. The average LGM SST in the Nordic Seas cannot at present be assessed with confidence. However, the existing evidence suggests that highly variable sea-surface conditions and at least occasional advection of North Atlantic waters may have characterised the glacial Nordic Seas.

The model suggests that the timing of the maximum seasonal production of planktonic foraminifera during the Last Glacial Maximum occurred at a different time of the year from present day. The assumption of ""stable"" seasonality through time, one of the underlying assumptions in paleoceanographical studies that utilize monospecific samples of planktic foraminifera, is thus mistaken. This finding entails implications for foraminifera-based paleotemperature reconstructions. The change in the timing of maximum foraminiferal production could lead to a bias in estimated paleotemperature if the change in seasonality is not taken into account. The existence of the potential seasonal bias is not a new concept in paleoceanography, but here we assess this bias for the first time from a comprehensive modeling approach. In tropical waters, where temperature seasonality has a relatively small amplitude, the estimated sea surface temperature is close to the annual mean. Thus, variations in foraminiferal seasonality do not cause a significant change in the recorded temperature. By contrast, changes in seasonality have the largest influence on the temperature signal at high latitudes and midlatitudes. Our model prediction suggests that because of the temperature sensitivity of the considered species, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the largest production of foraminifera occurred during a warmer season of the year. In some regions, the maximum foraminiferal production month shifted by up to 6 months. Our findings may help to reconcile low glacial planktonic delta O-18 values with proxy evidence for deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas.","[Fraile, I.; Schulz, M.; Mulitza, S.; Merkel, U.; Prange, M.; Paul, A.] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Schulz, M.; Mulitza, S.; Merkel, U.; Prange, M.; Paul, A.] Univ Bremen, MARUM, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738563; data\_collection\_article:Kucera, Michal; Weinelt, Mara; Kiefer, Thorsten; Pflaumann, Uwe; Hayes, Angela; Weinelt, Martin; Chen, Min-Te; Mix, Alan C; Barrows, Timothy T; Cortijo, Elsa; Duprat, Josette; Juggins, Steve; Waelbroeck, Claire (2005): Reconstruction of sea-surface temperatures from assemblages of planktonic foraminifera: multi-technique approach based on geographically constrained calibration datasets and its application to glacial Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

We show that, given an accurate ab initio predictor of the alignment tensor from a protein structure, it is possible to accurately assemble a protein-protein complex by utilizing the RDCs' sensitivity to molecular shape to guide the docking. The proposed docking method is robust against experimental errors in the RDCs and computationally efficient. We analyze the accuracy and efficiency of this method using experimental or synthetic RDC data for several proteins, as well as synthetic data for a large variety of protein-protein complexes. We also test our method on two protein systems for which the structure of the complex and steric-alignment data are available (Lys48-linked diubiquitin and a complex of ubiquitin and a ubiquitin-associated domain) and analyze the effect of flexible unstructured tails on the outcome of docking. The results demonstrate that it is fundamentally possible to assemble a protein-protein complex solely on the basis of experimental RDC data and the prediction of the alignment tensor from 3D structures.

SUD-M(513-651) exhibits a macrodomain fold containing the nsp3 residues 528 to 648, and there is a flexibly extended N-terminal tail with the residues 513 to 527 and a C-terminal flexible tail of residues 649 to 651. As a follow-up to this initial result, we also solved the structure of a construct representing only the globular domain of residues 527 to 651 [SUD-M(527-651)]. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments showed that SUD-M(527-651) binds single-stranded poly(A) and identified the contact area with this RNA on the protein surface, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays then confirmed that SUD-M has higher affinity for purine bases than for pyrimidine bases. In a further search for clues to the function, we found that SUD-M(527-651) has the closest three-dimensional structure homology with another domain of nsp3, the ADP-ribose-1""-phosphatase nsp3b, although the two proteins share only 5\% sequence identity in the homologous sequence regions. SUD-M(527-651) also shows three-dimensional structure homology with several helicases and nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins, but it does not contain the motifs of catalytic residues found in these structural homologues.

Correct subfamily classification has been problematic because Prx subfamilies are frequently not correlated with phylogenetic distribution and diverge in their preferred reductant, oligomerization state, and tendency toward overoxidation. We have developed a method that uses the Deacon Active Site Profiler (DASP) tool to extract functional-site profiles from structurally characterized proteins to computationally define subfamilies and to identify new Prx subfamily members from GenBank(nr). For the 58 literature-defined Prx test proteins, 57 were correctly assigned, and none were assigned to the incorrect subfamily. The >3500 putative Prx sequences identified were then used to analyze residue conservation in the active site of each Prx subfamily. Our results indicate that the existence and location of the resolving cysteine vary in some subfamilies (e.g., Prx5) to a greater degree than previously appreciated and that interactions at the A interface (common to Prx5, Tpx, and higher order AhpC/Prx1 structures) are important for stabilization of the correct active-site geometry. Interestingly, this method also allows us to further divide the AhpC/Prx1 into four groups that are correlated with functional characteristics. The DASP method provides more accurate subfamily classification than PSI-BLAST for members of the Prx family and can now readily be applied to other large protein families.",,"Vedadi M, Lew J, Artz J, Amani M, Zhao Y, Dong A, Wasney GA, Gao M, Hills T, Brokx S, Qiu W, Sharma S, Diassiti A, Alam Z, Melone M, Mulichak A, Wernimont A, Bray J, Loppnau P, Plotnikova O, Newberry K, Sundararajan E, Houston S, Walker J, Tempel W, Bochkarev A, Kozieradzki I, Edwards A, Arrowsmith C, Roos D, Kain K, Hui R.

Functional characterization of one of the intergenic CARs, Intergenic10, revealed that it regulates gene expression of neighboring genes through modulating the chromatin structure in cis.

Usually, patterns of gene expression in living organisms are often hidden inside numerous gene sequences and each sequence often appears to be unrelated. Therefore, a central issue here is that understanding of genetic mechanisms in plants and animals can provide an insight into how to manipulate genes, detect, prevent and control diseases both in plants and in animals. However, the success of this concept does not only depend on the ability to locate correlated genes in the A ymetrix GeneChip data, Which is mostly used in inves- tigating microarray experiments, it also depends on the ability to accurately detect distances of high and low correlation between the adjacent probe sets and to nd the hidden reasons for such correlations. Consequently, on attempting to investigate this case. A ymetrix GeneChip CEL les of Human Genome (HG-U133A) and Arabidopsis thaliana are specially downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GEO). By using R computer language and Bioconductor package, the data is normalised and correlation coecient measure were used to establish correlated values between the adjacent probe sets within the CEL les. Essentially, the results obtained showed that di erent patterns of correlation were found between the adjacent probe sets within both human genomes and Arabidopsis thaliana plant. The patterns of correlation are recorded in di erent experiments. For example, the pattern of correlation can be found between adjacent probe sets among sixteen experiments, while other patterns can be found from only two experiments.",,"Jack GD, Garst JF, Cabrera MC, DeSantis AM et al.

Experimental design Cell lines derived from surgically induced rat reflux esophageal tumors were passaged in vitro and transfected with GM-CSF. First, the GM-CSF whole cell vaccine was evaluated against subcutaneously transplanted esophageal tumor cells. In a subsequent study, the vaccine was tested to see if it could reduce the incidence of cancer in the surgical reflux model. Results While subcutaneously transplanted tumor cells produced lasting tumors in PBS non-vaccinated placebo rats, transplanted tumors regressed and were immunologically rejected in animals vaccinated prior to implantation. In the surgical reflux model, the vaccine reduced the incidence of cancer from 17/23 (74\%) in the controls to 6/16 (38\%) in the vaccinated animals (P = 0.046). Conclusions The GM-CSF whole cell tumor vaccine effectively promoted a strong immune response against subcutaneously transplanted tumors and protected animals from developing esophageal cancer in the reflux model.","[Harmon, John W.] Johns Hopkins Bayview Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Miyashita, Tomoharu; Shah, Furhawn A.; Marti, Guy P.; Wang, Jiaai; Bonde, Pramod; Duncan, Mark; Harmon, John W.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Baltimore, MD 21","; data\_id:GSE1707; data\_collection\_article:Bonde P, Sui G, Dhara S, Wang J et al.

In pathological myocardium, there is limited information on suitable reference genes other than the commonly used Gapdh mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA. Our aim was to evaluate and identify suitable reference genes in human failing myocardium, in rat and mouse post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) heart failure and across developmental stages in fetal and neonatal rat myocardium. Results: The abundance of Arbp, Rpl32, Rpl4, Tbp, Polr2a, Hprt1, Pgk1, Ppia and Gapdh mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA in myocardial samples was quantified by RT-qPCR. The expression variability of these transcripts was evaluated by the geNorm and Normfinder algorithms and by a variance component analysis method. Biological variability was a greater contributor to sample variability than either repeated reverse transcription or PCR reactions. Conclusions: The most stable reference genes were Rpl32, Gapdh and Polr2a in mouse post-infarction heart failure, Polr2a, Rpl32 and Tbp in rat post-infarction heart failure and Rpl32 and Pgk1 in human heart failure ( ischemic disease and cardiomyopathy). The overall most stable reference genes across all three species was Rpl32 and Polr2a. In rat myocardium, all reference genes tested showed substantial variation with developmental stage, with Rpl4 as was most stable among the tested genes.","[Winer, Lisbeth H.; Sejersted, Ole M.; Andersson, Kristin B.] Univ Oslo, Ulleval Hosp, Expt Med Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Brattelid, Trond; Levy, Finn Olav] Univ Oslo, Dept Pharmacol, Oslo, Norway; [Brattelid, Trond; Winer, Lisbeth H.; Levy, Finn Olav; Sej","; data\_id:GSE1957; data\_collection\_article:Andersson KB, Florholmen G, Winer LH, T\o nnessen T et al.

With the increasing number of experimental phosphorylation sites that has been identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the desire to explore the networks of protein kinases and substrates is motivated. Manning et al. have identified 518 human kinase genes, which provide a starting point for comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation networks. In this study, a knowledgebase is developed to integrate experimentally verified protein phosphorylation data and protein-protein interaction data for constructing the protein kinase-substrate phosphorylation networks in human. A total of 21,110 experimental verified phosphorylation sites within 5092 human proteins are collected. However, only 4138 phosphorylation sites (âˆ_20\%) have the annotation of catalytic kinases from public domain. In order to fully investigate how protein kinases regulate the intracellular processes, a published kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction tool, named KinasePhos is incorporated for assigning the potential kinase. The web-based system, RegPhos, can let users input a group of human proteins; consequently, the phosphorylation network associated with the protein subcellular localization can be explored. Additionally, time-coursed microarray expression data is subsequently used to represent the degree of similarity in the expression profiles of network members. A case study demonstrates that the proposed scheme not only identify the correct network of insulin signaling but also detect a novel signaling pathway that may cross-talk with insulin signaling network.

While several missing value imputation approaches are available to the microarray users and new ones are constantly being developed, there is no general consensus on how to choose between the different methods since their performance seems to vary drastically depending on the dataset being used. Results: We show that this discrepancy can mostly be attributed to the way in which imputation methods have traditionally been developed and evaluated. By comparing a number of advanced imputation methods on recent microarray datasets, we show that even when there are marked differences in the measurement-level imputation accuracies across the datasets, these differences become negligible when the methods are evaluated in terms of how well they can reproduce the original gene clusters or their biological interpretations. Regardless of the evaluation approach, however, imputation always gave better results than ignoring missing data points or replacing them with zeros or average values, emphasizing the continued importance of using more advanced imputation methods. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that, while missing values are still severely complicating microarray data analysis, their impact on the discovery of biologically meaningful gene groups can - up to a certain degree - be reduced by using readily available and relatively fast imputation methods, such as the Bayesian Principal Components Algorithm ( BPCA).","[Tuikkala, Johannes; Nevalainen, Olli S.] Univ Turku, Dept Informat Technol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Tuikkala, Johannes; Nevalainen, Olli S.] Univ Turku, TUCS, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Elo, Laura L.; Aittokallio, Tero] Univ Turku, Dept Math, FI-20014 T","; data\_id:GSE2239; data\_collection\_article:Shapira M, Segal E, Botstein D.

To address this issue we have profiled the transcriptional changes induced by short- and long-term expression of EBNA-1 in the EBV negative B-cell lymphoma BJAB. Three hundred and nineteen cellular genes were regulated in a conditional transfectant shortly after EBNA-1 induction while a ten fold higher number of genes was regulated upon continuous EBNA-1 expression. Promoter analysis of the differentially regulated genes demonstrated a significant enrichment of putative EBNA-1 binding sites suggesting that EBNA-1 may directly influence the transcription of a subset of genes. Gene ontology analysis of forty seven genes that were consistently regulated independently on the time of EBNA-1 expression revealed an unexpected enrichment of genes involved in the maintenance of chromatin architecture.

To gain more mechanistic insights into the underlying biology, overrepresentation analysis (ORA) is often conducted to investigate whether gene sets associated with particular biological functions, for example, as represented by Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, are statistically overrepresented in the identified gene groups. However, the standard ORA, which is based on the hypergeometric test, analyzes each GO term in isolation and does not take into account the dependence structure of the GO-term hierarchy. RESULTS: We have developed a Bayesian approach (GO-Bayes) to measure overrepresentation of GO terms that incorporates the GO dependence structure by taking into account evidence not only from individual GO terms, but also from their related terms (i.e. parents, children, siblings, etc.). The Bayesian framework borrows information across related GO terms to strengthen the detection of overrepresentation signals. As a result, this method tends to identify sets of closely related GO terms rather than individual isolated GO terms. The advantage of the GO-Bayes approach is demonstrated with a simulation study and an application example.",,"Basso K, Margolin AA, Stolovitzky G, Klein U et al.

However, common procedures to normalize expression profiles generated using the Affymetrix GeneChips technology were originally developed for a rather different purpose, namely the accurate measure of differential gene expression between two or more phenotypes. As a result, current evaluation strategies lack comprehensive metrics to assess the suitability of available normalization procedures for reverse engineering and, in general, for measuring correlation between the expression profiles of a gene pair. RESULTS: We benchmark four commonly used normalization procedures (MAS5, RMA, GCRMA and Li-Wong) in the context of established algorithms for the reverse engineering of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Replicate sample, randomized and human B-cell data sets are used as an input. Surprisingly, our study suggests that MAS5 provides the most faithful cellular network reconstruction. Furthermore, we identify a crucial step in GCRMA responsible for introducing severe artifacts in the data leading to a systematic overestimate of pairwise correlation. This has key implications not only for reverse engineering but also for other methods, such as hierarchical clustering, relying on accurate measurements of pairwise expression profile correlation.

However, not all patients can be cured and the development of alternative treatment strategies is necessary. Materials and Methods: Gene expression in HL cell lines was analyzed using DNA microarrays and both conventional and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sensitivity of HL cell lines to the cell cycle inhibitor roscovitine was assessed in vitro. Results: All HL cell lines express high levels of cyclin D2. Treatment of HL cells with roscovitine induced cell death in some cell lines whereas other cell lines were resistant to roscovitine. Roscovitine-sensitive cell lines were characterized by expression of T-cell markers and expressed high levels of the unusual cytokine interleukin-26.

RESULTS: We apply PCIT to a series of simulated datasets with varying levels of complexity in terms of number of genes and experimental conditions, as well as to three real datasets. Results show that, as opposed to the constant cutoff approach commonly used in the literature, the PCIT algorithm can identify and allow for more moderate, yet not less significant, estimates of correlation (r) to still establish a connection in the GCN. We show that PCIT is more sensitive than established methods and capable of detecting functionally validated gene-gene interactions coming from absolute r values as low as 0.3. These bona fide associations, which often relate to genes with low variation in expression patterns, are beyond the detection limits of conventional fixed-threshold methods, and would be overlooked by studies relying on those methods.

Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72\%), 10p (55\%), 10q (55\%), 9q (49\%), 6q (43\%), 11q (43\%), and 17p (41\%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas.

Advances in microarray technology have allowed for greater resolution in detection of DNA copy number changes (amplifications or deletions) across the genome. However, the increase in number of measured signals and accompanying noise from the array probes present a challenge in accurate and fast identification of breakpoints that define CNA. This article proposes a novel detection technique that exploits the use of piece wise constant (PWC) vectors to represent genome copy number and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to detect CNA breakpoints. METHODS: First, a compact linear algebra representation for the genome copy number is developed from normalized probe intensities. Second, SBL is applied and optimized to infer locations where copy number changes occur. Third, a backward elimination (BE) procedure is used to rank the inferred breakpoints; and a cut-off point can be efficiently adjusted in this procedure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). RESULTS: The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using simulated and real genome datasets and compared to other existing techniques. Our approach achieves the highest accuracy and lowest FDR while improving computational speed by several orders of magnitude. The proposed algorithm has been developed into a free standing software application (GADA, Genome Alteration Detection Algorithm).

This massive parallel measurement power has an enormous potential for research in Biology and Medicine with the ultimate objective of identifying and learning the biological processes occurring in different organisms and diseases. Existing model learning methods are severely limited by the reduced number of samples that are usually available compared to the measurements. We propose that sparse signal representations can model these biological signals and we develop the analytical tools to accurately extract the relevant information. We exploit the underlying sparseness of the biological model to overcome some of the problems associated with analyzing these massive datasets. This work demonstrates the potential benefits of this approach by studying three different problems involving microarray data. The first problem concerns the supervised design with a limited amount of training samples of a classification procedure to predict tumor progression. We propose a greedy search strategy to select a sparse feature subset with a block diagonal covariance matrix structure to build a linear discriminant analysis model for tumor prognosis. The second problem deals with the detection of copy number alterations. We develop a maximally sparse representation for these copy number alterations, and a sparse Bayesian learning approach is optimized to detect these alterations from noisy microarray observations. The third problem involves finding genetic determinants of gene expression. In this case, we propose a linear regression model with a sparse Bayesian prior on the large matrix of the regression coefficients relating genome alterations to transcription levels.",,"Garraway LA, Widlund HR, Rubin MA, Getz G et al.

We demonstrate that the selective activation of a subset of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) cistrome in MCF7 breast cancer cells provides specificity to the estradiol (E2) response. ER alpha-specific enhancers that are subject to E2-induced coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) action are critical to E2-stimulated gene expression. This is true for both FoxA1-dependent and independent enhancers. In contrast, a subset of E2-suppressed genes are controlled by FoxA1-independent ER alpha binding sites. Nonetheless, these are sites of E2-induced CARM1 activity. In addition, the MCF7 RNA polymerase II cistrome reveals preferential occupancy of E2-regulated promoters prior to stimulation. Interestingly, E2-suppressed genes tend to lie in otherwise silent genomic regions. Together, our results suggest that the transcriptional response to E2 in breast cancer cells is dependent on the interplay between polymerase II pre-occupied promoters and the subset of the ER alpha cistrome associated with coactivation.","[Lupien, Mathieu; Eeckhoute, Jerome; Krum, Susan A.; Brown, Myles] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Div Mol \& Cellular Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lupien, Mathieu; Eeckhoute, Jerome; Krum, Susan A.; Brown, Myles] Brigham \& Womens Hosp, Dept Med, B","; data\_id:GSE2603; data\_collection\_article:Minn AJ, Gupta GP, Siegel PM, Bos PD et al.

Overexpression of c-myc in humans correlates with metastases, but transgenic mice only show low rates of micrometastases. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress both c-myc and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Myc/VEGF) in the mammary gland, which develop high rates of pulmonary macrometastases. Gene expression profiling revealed a set of deregulated genes in Myc/VEGF tumors compared to Myc tumors associated with the increased metastatic phenotype. Cross-comparisons between this set of genes with a human breast cancer lung metastasis gene signature identified five common targets: tenascin-C(TNC), matrix metalloprotease-2, collagen-6-A1, mannosidase-alpha-1A and HLA-DPA1. Signaling blockade or knockdown of TNC in MDA-MB-435 cells resulted in a significant impairment of cell migration and anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Mice injected with clonal MDA-MB-435 cells with reduced expression of TNC demonstrated a significant decrease (P<0.05) in (1) primary tumor growth; (2) tumor relapse after surgical removal of the primary tumor and (3) incidence of lung metastasis.

Oncogenic transformation increases the expression of tissue factor (TF) that results in local generation of coagulation proteases and activation of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-2. We compared the PAR-dependent expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 in 2 murine mammary adencocarcinoma cell lines: metastatic 4T1 cells and nonmetastatic 67NR cells. 4T1 cells expressed TF, PAR-1 and PAR-2 whereas 67NR cells expressed TF and PAR-1. We also silenced PAR-1 or PAR-2 expression in the 4T1 cells. We discovered 2 distinct mechanisms for PAR-dependent expression of uPA and PAI-1. First, we found that factor Xa or thrombin activation of PAR-1 led to a rapid release of stored intracellular uPA into the culture supernatant. Second, thrombin transactivation of a PAR-1/PAR-2 complex resulted in increases in PAI-1 mRNA and protein expression. Cells lacking PAR-2 failed to express PAI-1 in response to thrombin and factor Xa did not activate the PAR-1/PAR-2 complex.

To broaden our knowledge of the regulatory potential of PADI4, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter tiling array (ChIP-chip) analysis to more comprehensively investigate the range of PADI4 target genes across the genome in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Results showed that PADI4 is enriched in gene promoter regions near transcription start sites (TSSs); and, surprisingly, this pattern of binding is primarily associated with actively transcribed genes. Computational analysis found potential binding sites for Elk-1, a member of the ETS oncogene family, to be highly enriched around PADI4 binding sites; and coimmunoprecipitation analysis then confirmed that Elk-1 physically associates with PADI4. To better understand how PADI4 may facilitate gene transactivation, we then show that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 at the c-Fos promoter and that, following Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulation, PADI4 catalytic activity facilitates Elk-1 phosphorylation, histone H4 acetylation, and c-Fos transcriptional activation.

The independence assumption implies that the number of false rejections V follows a binomial distribution and leads to an estimator of the empirical false discovery rate (eFDR). The number of false rejections V is modeled with the beta-binomial distribution. An estimator of the beta-binomial false discovery rate (bbFDR) is then derived. This approach accounts for how the correlation among non-differentially expressed genes influences the distribution of V. Permutations are used to generate the observed values for V under the null hypotheses and a beta-binomial distribution is fit to the values of V. The bbFDR estimator is compared to the eFDR estimator in simulation studies of correlated non-differentially expressed genes and is found to outperform the eFDR for certain scenarios.

HOROWITZ. Soleus Adaptation to Combined Exercise and Heat Acclimation: Physiogenomic Aspects. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 42, No. 5, pp. 943-952, 2010. Introduction: Adaptation to heat (acclimation [ACC]) and exercise training (EX) require global changes at all levels of body organization to enhance muscle performance. In this investigation, we combined these stressors and examined physiological and genomic aspects of adaptation in skeletal muscle (soleus). Methods: Rats were divided into four groups: C (controls), ACC-acclimated to heat only at 34 degrees C, EX-aerobic exercise on a treadmill at 24 degrees C, and EXAC-acclimated to combined heat and aerobic training. The ACC period was 30 d. Isometric force generation was measured using isolated muscle preparations stimulated at 1-100 Hz, allowing assessment of muscle endurance. Global genomic responses of homeostatic genes were detected using a complementary DNA (cDNA) Atlas array (Rat 1.2; Clontech Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA). Results: Significantly elevated force generation (P < 0.05) was only found in the EXAC group along with a marked decrease in relaxation velocity. Both heat-treated groups (ACC and EXAC) demonstrated less of a drop in power at stimulation frequencies above the highest force generation (P G 0.05). Gene reprogramming was noted in all treatment groups with stressor-specific dynamic profiles. Improved force generation in the EXAC soleus coincided with significant up-regulation in expression levels of genes encoding sarcoplasmic Ca2+-transporting proteins (SERCA2 and inositol triphospate receptor), glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme (phosphofructokinase), mitochondrial lipid metabolism (CPTII), and stress proteins with antiapoptotic or apoptotic activity. Conclusions: Our data suggest that EXAC-specific gene up-regulation and cross talk between genes assigned to their gene ontology categories (transport, metabolism, and stress) differ in abundance and/or expression level (compared with other treatment groups) and contributed to the physiological advantage demonstrated by the EXAC soleus.","[Kodesh, Einat; Horowitz, Michal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Environm Physiol Lab, Fac Med Dent, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; PHILADELPHIA; 530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA","; data\_id:GSE2890; data\_collection\_article:Schwimmer H, Eli-Berchoer L, Horowitz M.

The abundance of gene expression microarray data currently available to the scientific community makes it possible to assess gene transcript levels among diverse tissue types for an entire genome. Gene expression is controlled over a wide range at the transcript level through complex interplay between DNA and regulatory proteins, resulting in gene expression profiles that can be represented as normal, graded, and bimodal (switch-like) distributions. It is our assertion that these distributions of gene expression, notably the bimodal distribution, result from biologically relevant regulation events. We have performed genome-scale identification and annotation of genes with bimodal, switch-like expression at the transcript level in human and mouse, using large microarray datasets for healthy tissue, in order to study the cellular pathways and regulatory mechanisms involving this class of genes. Our method implemented a likelihood ratio test to identify bimodal genes by comparing the best-fit two-component normal mixture, estimated using the expectation maximization algorithm, against a single-component normal distribution for each gene. This procedure identified roughly 15\% of genes in human and mouse as bimodal, with a substantial overlap between human genes and their orthologous mouse counterparts. A survey of biological pathways revealed that the set of bimodal genes plays a role in cell communication and signaling with the external environment. Our analysis of regulatory sequence regions for bimodal genes revealed characteristics including enrichment of TATA boxes and an increased number of alternative transcription start sites. In addition to regulatory sequence analysis, we explored aspects of epigenetic regulation for their activity among the set of bimodal genes. We performed meta-analysis of gene expression microarray, DNA methylation, and histone methylation datasets representing human stem cells and liver tissue to reveal that the mode of expression within switch-like genes is primarily associated with histone methylation status. These results provide insight to normal patterns of histone methylation in healthy, differentiated tissue types. Aberrant methylation is a known marker in the progression of cancer, so these switch-like genes may also provide a valuable reference in disease diagnosis and prognosis. The method presented for bimodal gene identification also allows for an alternate approach to differential gene expression analysis between tissues and disease subtypes.",,"Lan H, Rabaglia ME, Stoehr JP, Nadler ST et al.

As a complex metabolic pathway, the regulation of starch biosynthesis is still poorly understood. We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch biosynthesis by gene coexpression analysis in rice (Oryza sativa). Starch synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in seeds; sink tissues) and type II (in vegetative tissues; source tissues), and 307 and 621 coexpressed genes are putatively involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice seeds and vegetative tissues, respectively. Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1), an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and RSR1 deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds. Seeds of the knockout mutant rsr1 consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature. In addition, rsr1 mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield. In contrast, RSR1 overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature. Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in rsr1 results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in RSR1-overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch. These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of RSR1, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition.",,"Walia H, Wilson C, Condamine P, Liu X et al.

Owing to their participation in the control of pathogen morphogenesis, differentiation and virulence, it was decided to characterize ras genes in P. brasiliensis. ras1 and ras2 were identified to be coding for two different proteins with high identity. The ras transcriptional pattern was investigated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) during mycelium-to-yeast (M -> Y) transition, heat shock at 42 degrees C and after internalization of yeast cells by murine macrophages. Both genes were downregulated inside macrophages and ras1, at 42 degrees C. In contrast, ras genes did not show any transcriptional variation during the M -> Y transition. The fact that Ras proteins are attached to the membrane via farnesylation prompted the use of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor to investigate the importance of this process for vegetative growth and dimorphic transition. Farnesylation blockage interfered with the vegetative growth of yeast cells and stimulated germinative tube production even at 37 degrees C. During Y -> M transition, the inhibitor increased filamentation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that impaired farnesylation favours the mycelium form of P. brasiliensis. The results suggest that ras genes might have a role in dimorphism, heat shock response and in host-pathogen interaction.","[Fernandes, Larissa; Paes, Hugo C.; Tavares, Aldo H.; Silva, Simoneide S.; Dantas, Alessandra; Torres, Fernando A.

GeneClass is motivated by the hypothesis that in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in a particular microarray experiment based on the presence of binding site subsequences (""motifs"") in the gene's regulatory region and the expression levels of regulators such as transcription factors in the experiment (""parents""). GeneClass formulates the learning task as a classification problem - predicting +1 and -1 labels corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. Using the Adaboost algorithm, GeneClass learns a prediction function in the form of an alternating decision tree, a margin-based generalization of a decision tree. Methods: In the current work, we introduce a new, robust version of the GeneClass algorithm that increases stability and computational efficiency, yielding a more scalable and reliable predictive model. The improved stability of the prediction tree enables us to introduce a detailed post-processing framework for biological interpretation, including individual and group target gene analysis to reveal condition-specific regulation programs and to suggest signaling pathways. Robust GeneClass uses a novel stabilized variant of boosting that allows a set of correlated features, rather than single features, to be included at nodes of the tree; in this way, biologically important features that are correlated with the single best feature are retained rather than decorrelated and lost in the next round of boosting. Other computational developments include fast matrix computation of the loss function for all features, allowing scalability to large datasets, and the use of abstaining weak rules, which results in a more shallow and interpretable tree. We also show how to incorporate genome-wide protein-DNA binding data from ChIP chip experiments into the GeneClass algorithm, and we use an improved noise model for gene expression data. Results: Using the improved scalability of Robust GeneClass, we present larger scale experiments on a yeast environmental stress dataset, training and testing on all genes and using a comprehensive set of potential regulators. We demonstrate the improved stability of the features in the learned prediction tree, and we show the utility of the post-processing framework by analyzing two groups of genes in yeast - the protein chaperones and a set of putative targets of the Nrg1 and Nrg2 transcription factors - and suggesting novel hypotheses about their transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.

A topic of great interest is to study the different expression profiles between microarray samples from cancer patients and normal subjects, by classifying them at gene expression levels. Currently, various clustering methods have been proposed in the literature to classify cancer and normal samples based on microarray data, and they are predominantly data-driven approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, a model-driven approach, which can reveal the relationship between the global gene expression profile and the subject's health status, and thus is promising in predicting the early development of cancer. Results: In this work, we propose an ensemble dependence model, aimed at exploring the group dependence relationship of gene clusters. Under the framework of hypothesis-testing, we employ genes' dependence relationship as a feature to model and classify cancer and normal samples. The proposed classification scheme is applied to several real cancer datasets, including cDNA, Affymetrix microarray and proteomic data. It is noted that the proposed method yields very promising performance. We further investigate the eigen-value pattern of the proposed method, and we discover different patterns between cancer and normal samples. Moreover, the transition between cancer and normal patterns suggests that the eigen-value pattern of the proposed models may have potential to predict the early stage of cancer development. In addition, we examine the effects of possible model mismatch on the proposed scheme.","Univ Maryland, Dept Elect \& Comp Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect \& Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; OXFORD; GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","; data\_id:GSE3398; data\_collection\_article:Garber ME, Troyanskaya OG, Schluens K, Petersen S et al.

There have been many different procedures for selecting coexpressed gene pairs of high functional similarity from an expression dataset. However, it is not clear which procedure performs best as there are few studies reporting comparisons of these approaches. The goal of this thesis is to develop a set of â€œbest practicesâ€ù in order to select coexpression links of high functional similarity from an expression dataset, along which methods for identifying datasets likely to yield poor information. With these goals, we hope to improve the quality of gene function predictions produced by coexpression analysis. Using 80 human expression datasets we examined the impact of different thresholds, correlation metrics, expression data filtering and transformation procedures on performance in functional prediction. We also investigated the relationship between data quality and other features of expression datasets and their performance in functional prediction. We used the annotations of the Gene Ontology as a primary metric to measure similarity in gene function, and employ additional functional metrics for validation. Our results show that several dataset features have a greater influence on the performance in functional prediction than others. Expression datasets which produce coexpressed gene pairs of poor functional quality can be identified by a similar set of data features. Some procedures used in coexpression analysis have a negligible effect on the quality of functional predictions while others are essential to achieving the best performance in the algorithm. We also find that some procedures interact greatly with features of expression datasets and that these interactions increase the number of high quality coexpressed gene pairs retrieved through coexpression iii analysis. This thesis uncovers important information on the many intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the performance in functional prediction of coexpression analysis. The information summarized here will help guide future studies using coexpression analysis and improve the quality of gene function predictions.",,"Garber ME, Troyanskaya OG, Schluens K, Petersen S et al.

The majority of these mutations are due to insertions of two high copy ERV families, the IAP and ETn/MusD elements. This significant level of ongoing retrotranspositional activity suggests that inbred mice are highly variable in content of these two ERV groups. However, no comprehensive genome-wide studies have been performed to assess their level of polymorphism. Here we compared three test strains, for which sufficient genomic sequence is available, to each other and to the reference C57BL/6J genome and detected very high levels of insertional polymorphism for both ERV families, with an estimated false discovery rate of only 0.4\%. Specifically, we found that at least 60\% of IAP and 25\% of ETn/MusD elements detected in any strain are absent in one or more of the other three strains. The polymorphic nature of a set of 40 ETn/MusD elements found within gene introns was confirmed using genomic PCR on DNA from a panel of mouse strains. For some cases, we detected gene-splicing abnormalities involving the ERV and obtained additional evidence for decreased gene expression in strains carrying the insertion. In total, we identified nearly 700 polymorphic IAP or ETn/MusD ERVs or solitary LTRs that reside in gene introns, providing potential candidates that may contribute to gene expression differences among strains.

However, not all patients can be cured and the development of alternative treatment strategies is necessary. Materials and Methods: Gene expression in HL cell lines was analyzed using DNA microarrays and both conventional and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sensitivity of HL cell lines to the cell cycle inhibitor roscovitine was assessed in vitro. Results: All HL cell lines express high levels of cyclin D2. Treatment of HL cells with roscovitine induced cell death in some cell lines whereas other cell lines were resistant to roscovitine. Roscovitine-sensitive cell lines were characterized by expression of T-cell markers and expressed high levels of the unusual cytokine interleukin-26.

To better understand the metabolic changes associated with these phenotypes, we performed microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression in chow-and VLF-fed female Scd1(+/+) and Scd1(-/)-mice. We identified an extraordinary number of differentially expressed genes (> 4,000 probe sets) in the VLF Scd1(-/)-relative to both VLF Scd1(+/+) and chow Scd1(-/)-mice. Transcript levels were reduced for genes involved in detoxification and several facets of fatty acid metabolism including biosynthesis, elongation, desaturation, oxidation, transport, and ketogenesis. This pattern is attributable to the decreased mRNA abundance of several genes encoding key transcription factors, including LXR alpha, RXR alpha, FXR, PPAR alpha, PGC-1 beta, SREBP1c, ChREBP, CAR, DBP, TEF, and HLF. A robust induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is indicated by enhanced splicing of XBP1, increased expression of the stress-induced transcription factors CHOP and ATF3, and elevated expression of several genes involved in the integrated stress and unfolded protein response pathways. The gene expression profile is also consistent with induction of an acute inflammatory response and macrophage recruitment. These results highlight the importance of monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the absence of sufficient dietary unsaturated fat and point to a novel cellular nutrient-sensing mechanism linking fatty acid availability and/or composition to the ER stress response.","[Flowers, Matthew T.; Keller, Mark P.; Lan, Hong; Ntambi, James M.; Attie, Alan D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Flowers, Matthew T.; Ntambi, James M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Nutr Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Choi, YounJeong; Kendzi","; data\_id:GSE3889; data\_collection\_article:Flowers MT, Groen AK, Oler AT, Keller MP et al.

Upregulation of GOLPH2 mRNA has been recently reported in expression array analyses of prostate cancer. As GOLPH2 protein expression in prostate tissues is currently unknown, this study aimed at a comprehensive analysis of GOLPH2 protein in benign and malignant prostate lesions. Immunohistochemically detected GOLPH2 protein expression was compared with the basal cell marker p63 and the prostate cancer marker alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) in 614 radical prostatectomy specimens. GOLPH2 exhibited a perinuclear Golgi-type staining pattern and was preferentially seen in prostatic gland epithelia. Using a semiquantitative staining intensity score, GOLPH2 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer glands compared with normal glands (P < 0.001). GOLPH2 protein was upregulated in 567 of 614 tumours (92.3\%) and AMACR in 583 of 614 tumours (95\%) (correlation coefficient 0.113, P = 0.005). Importantly, GOLPH2 immunohistochemistry exhibited a lower level of intratumoral heterogeneity (25 vs 45\%). Further, GOLPH2 upregulation was detected in 26 of 31 (84\%) AMACR-negative prostate cancer cases. These data clearly suggest GOLPH2 as an additional ancillary positive marker for tissue-based diagnosis of prostate cancer.","[Kristiansen, G.; Fritzsche, F.

Here, the frontal sinuses from 62 species of bovids were investigated using Xray computed tomog raphy. This survey revealed hitherto undescribed diversity in the morphology of this sinus, and suggests that it was probably present in the common ancestor of Bovidae, Among extant bovids, the frontal sinuses were lost or reduced to recesses at least six different times Quantitative analyses, when accounting for phylogeny using phylogeneti cally independent contrasts, did not find any link between the size or complexity of the frontal sinus and head-to-head ramming behaviour. Other analyses indicated that frontal sinus size was correlated most closely with the size of the frontal bone itself rather than with the overall skull size or horn size. These results may be partially consistent with the hypothesis of sinuses being the result of 'opportunistic pneumatization', in which sinus size depends on the quantity of bone available for pneuinatization as well as the mechanical demands placed on the skull. Additional evidence also indicates a strong phylogenetic correlation with sinus morphology, particularly with regard to the presence of paranasal diverticula, as well as the ability of sinuses to cross sutural boundaries.

At the sequence level, covarion-like evolution at a site manifests as conservation of nucleotide or amino acid states among some homologs where the states are not conserved in other homologs (or groups of homologs). Covarion-like evolution has been shown to relate to changes in functions at sites in different clades, and, if ignored, can adversely affect the accuracy of phylogenetic inference. Results: PROCOV (protein covarion analysis) is a software tool that implements a number of previously proposed covarion models of protein evolution for phylogenetic inference in a maximum likelihood framework. Several algorithmic and implementation improvements in this tool over previous versions make computationally expensive tree searches with covarion models more efficient and analyses of large phylogenomic data sets tractable. PROCOV can be used to identify covarion sites by comparing the site likelihoods under the covarion process to the corresponding site likelihoods under a rates-across-sites (RAS) process. Those sites with the greatest log-likelihood difference between a 'covarion' and an RAS process were found to be of functional or structural significance in a dataset of bacterial and eukaryotic elongation factors. Conclusion: Covarion models implemented in PROCOV may be especially useful for phylogenetic estimation when ancient divergences between sequences have occurred and rates of evolution at sites are likely to have changed over the tree. It can also be used to study lineage-specific functional shifts in protein families that result in changes in the patterns of site variability among subtrees.","[Wang, Huai-Chun; Susko, Edward] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Math \& Stat, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada; [Wang, Huai-Chun; Roger, Andrew J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biochem \& Mol Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 1X5, Canada; [Wang, Huai-Chun; Susko, Edward; Roger, Andrew J.] Da","; data\_id:S1430; data\_collection\_article:Brinkmann H., Giezen M., Zhou Y., Raucourt G., \& Philippe H. 2005.

In this study, the Quaternary superficial deposits from two shallow bays in Hong Kong are examined in order to identify the timing of such episodes. Two rotary boreholes in Tai O Bay penetrated a succession of marine and terrestrial deposits formed during the last four interglacial-glacial cycles. The interglacial periods and the glacial periods are found to be represented by siliciclastic-dominated shallow marine-estuarine deposits and colluvial-alluvial fan deposits, respectively. An excavation of a coastal land reclamation in Deep Bay revealed Holocene intertidal-subtidal estuarine deposits overlying aeolian deposits of the last glacial age. Optically Stimulated luminescence dating carried out has confirmed the last glacial age of the terrestrial unit unconformably overlain by the Holocene marine unit but only minimum ages can be obtained from the pre-last glacial terrestrial units. In one of the Tai O boreholes studied, the density and moisture content distribution is found to reflect the episodes of subaerial exposure of the pre-Holocene interglacial marine units. In the palaeo-desiccated crusts of these units, density increases through iron cementation resulting from acid-sulphate soil development while moisture content decreases as a consequence of desiccation. Quaternary terrestrial deposits occurring on continental shelves are therefore datable to a greater degree of certainty than their subaerial counterparts. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The aim of this study was to obtain a detailed reconstruction of the paleoceanographic conditions in the western Atlantic during the Valanginian positive delta C-13(carb) excursion. The well-constrained stratigraphic framework for both sites allows for a supraregional comparison with previous studies in Western Europe. At both sites, the Berriasian-Valanginian boundary interval is characterized by a 20\% increase in the relative abundance of calcareous nannofossil species that are indicative of elevated surface-water nutrient levels. These changes in the trophic system coincide with the turning point toward more positive delta C-13(carb), values at the M15-M14 magnetochron boundary, leading to the well-known Valanginian positive delta C-13(carb), excursion. These changes also correspond with an increase in bulk-rock Sr/Ca ratios, enhanced burial of organic matter, and, at Hole 534A, a decrease in rock-forming nannoconids. Calcareous nannofossil data do not support a substantial cooling in the western Atlantic, as previously suggested by the geochemistry of belemnite rostra, but the observed increase in nutrients is consistent with enhanced upwelling during the Valanginian. Owing to controversial placement of the Valanginian-Hauterivian boundary and different absolute ages for the Valanginian stage, it is still unclear to what extent the Parana-Etendeka voicanism might have caused the biotic and carbon-cycle perturbations. Our data suggest that the changes documented in the marine plankton system are at least concomitant with the initial, minor phase of the Parana-Etendeka volcanism.","[Bornemann, Andre] Univ Leipzig, Inst Geol \& Geophys, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Mutterlose, Joerg] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral \& Geophys, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; TULSA; 6128 EAST 38TH ST, STE 308, TULSA, OK 74135-5814 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.737945; data\_collection\_article:Bornemann, Andr\'{e}; Pross, J\""{o}rg; Reichelt, Kerstin; Herrle, Jens O; Hemleben, Christoph; Mutterlose, J\""{o}rg (2005): Reconstruction of short-term palaeoceanographic changes during the formation of the Late Albian Niveau Breistroffer black shales (Oceanic Anoxic Event 1d, SE France).

We report here control networks in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that respond to photosynthetic stress. We independently subjected Arabidopsis leaves to two commonly used photosystem II inhibitors: high light (HL) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). Microarray analysis of expression patterns during the period of redox adjustment to these inhibitors reveals that 20\% and 8\% of the transcriptome are under HL and DCMU regulation, respectively. Approximately 6\% comprise a subset of genes common to both perturbations, the redox responsive genes (RRGs). A redox network was generated in an attempt to identify genes whose expression is tightly coordinated during adjustment to homeostasis, using expression of these RRGs under HL conditions. Ten subnetworks were identified from the network. Hierarchal subclustering of subnetworks responding to the DCMU stress identified novel groups of genes that were tightly controlled while adjusting to homeostasis. Upstream analysis of the promoters of the genes in these clusters revealed different motifs for each subnetwork, including motifs that were previously identified with responses to other stresses, such as light, dehydration, or abscisic acid. Functional categorization of RRGs demonstrated involvement of genes in many metabolic pathways, including several families of transcription factors, especially those in the AP2 family. Using a T-DNA insertion in one AP2 transcription factor (redox-responsive transcription factor 1 [RRTF1]) from the RRGs, we showed that the genes predicted to be within the subnetwork containing RRTF1 were changed in this insertion line (Delta rrtf1). Furthermore, Delta rrtf1 showed greater sensitivity to photosynthetic stress compared to the wild type.","[Khandelwal, Abha; Quatrano, Ralph S.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Elvitigala, Thanura] Washington Univ, Dept Elect \& Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Ghosh, Bijoy] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Math \& Stat, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; ROCK","; data\_id:GSE1174; data\_collection\_article:Biehl A, Richly E, Noutsos C, Salamini F et al.

The majority of these mutations are due to insertions of two high copy ERV families, the IAP and ETn/MusD elements. This significant level of ongoing retrotranspositional activity suggests that inbred mice are highly variable in content of these two ERV groups. However, no comprehensive genome-wide studies have been performed to assess their level of polymorphism. Here we compared three test strains, for which sufficient genomic sequence is available, to each other and to the reference C57BL/6J genome and detected very high levels of insertional polymorphism for both ERV families, with an estimated false discovery rate of only 0.4\%. Specifically, we found that at least 60\% of IAP and 25\% of ETn/MusD elements detected in any strain are absent in one or more of the other three strains. The polymorphic nature of a set of 40 ETn/MusD elements found within gene introns was confirmed using genomic PCR on DNA from a panel of mouse strains. For some cases, we detected gene-splicing abnormalities involving the ERV and obtained additional evidence for decreased gene expression in strains carrying the insertion. In total, we identified nearly 700 polymorphic IAP or ETn/MusD ERVs or solitary LTRs that reside in gene introns, providing potential candidates that may contribute to gene expression differences among strains. These extreme levels of polymorphism suggest that ERV insertions play a significant role in genetic drift of mouse lines.",,"Eichberger T, Sander V, Schnidar H, Regl G et al.

We identified 68 different large-sequence polymorphisms (comprising 186,137 bp, or 4.2\% of the genome) that are present in H37Rv, but absent from one or more clinical isolates. A total of 224 genes (5.5\%), including genes in all major functional categories, were found to be partially or completely deleted. Deletions are not distributed randomly throughout the genome but instead tend to be aggregated. The distinct deletions in some aggregations appear in closely related isolates, suggesting a genomically disruptive process specific to an individual mycobacterial lineage. Other genomic aggregations include distinct deletions that appear in phylogenetically unrelated isolates, suggesting that a genomic region is vulnerable throughout the species. Although the deletions identified here are evidently inessential to the causation of disease (they are found in active clinical cases), their frequency spectrum suggests that most are weakly deleterious to the pathogen. For some deletions, short-term evolutionary pressure due to the host immune system or antibiotics may favor the elimination of genes, whereas longer-term physiological requirements maintain the genes in the population.","Stanford Univ, Ctr Med, Div Infect Dis \& Geog Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Inst Mexicano Seguro Social, Unidad Invest Med Enfermedades Infecciosas \& Para, Mexico City 06725, DF, Mexico; WASHINGTON; 210","; data\_id:GSE3564; data\_collection\_article:Chan K, Baker S, Kim CC, Detweiler CS et al.

The 1.3-6.8m thick beds represent a bundle of precession couplets inferred to have been deposited during a short-term cycle of sea-level change triggered by the 100kyr short eccentricity cycle within the Milankovitch periodicities. A burrowed omission surface terminates the Schloenbachia/Inoceramus virgatus Event in most places. Rock accumulation rates vary in different sections between 13 and 68Bubnoff units (mm/kyr) for the complete 100kyr cycle with extreme values ranging from 10 to 100Bubnoffs at shorter (i.e., 20kyr precession couplet) scales. Taphonomic and microfacies trends suggest deposition below fair-weather wave base with frequent to sporadic reworking of the sea-floor by storm waves for proximal and medial sections. The distal sections were close to, or even slightly below, maximum storm wave base. The biofacies of the Schloenbachia/Inoceramus virgatus Event is strongly dominated by inoceramid bivalves (65-85\%). The two representatives of Inoceramus virgatus, I. virgatus virgatus Schluter and I virgatus scalprum Bohm, are not geographic subspecies as they co-occur in the same beds. However, proximal morphs tend to be more strongly ribbed and flatter whereas distal ones are more inflated and smoother, representing ecophenotypes of one polymorphic species. Taphonomic observations and shell morphology suggest that the inoceramids lived as epibyssate recliners. The low species richness and fossil content of the event strata (without the inoceramid bivalves) are attributed to low fluxes of organic matter to the sea-bed during the maximum flooding interval of Cenomanian depositional sequence Ce III. The inoceramids of the virgatus plexus are inferred to have been very effective filter feeders flourishing under nutrient-depleted, low-energy conditions. The Schloenbachia/Inoceramus virgatus Event is an example of a maximum flooding bioevent, forming a widespread marker dominated largely by autochthonous biota. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The samples were recovered from overbank deposits on a marine terrace situated 4 km east of Westport, New Zealand (41 degrees 45' S, 171 degrees 36' E). The age of the site is constrained to between 74 and 40 ka but discrepancies between luminescence and radiocarbon age results prevent more precise age control. The older of two samples indicates a closed canopy Nothofagus (southern beech) forest with deep litter and dead.wood on the forest floor. The younger sample yields a similar Nothofagus forest environment with subalpine affinities and nearby tussock grassland. For the older sample, mean summer and winter minimum temperatures were similar to modern values. Mean summer temperature was ca. 3.0 degrees C cooler than modern during the younger phase while mean minimum winter temperature was ca. 5.0 degrees C cooler than present indicating both cooling and increased seasonality. Both samples suggest a 30-40\% decrease in mean annual precipitation from modern values. Persistence of closed canopy Nothofagus forest during the period of 74-40 ka contrasts with regional pollen studies which imply widespread shrub-land at these times. This implies that this site may have served as a glacial refugium for Nothofagus forest.

Some oceanic realms, however, remain poorly studied. We document U-37(K) index data for two sediment cores retrieved from the South Tasman Sea, one west of New Zealand (SO136-GC3) and the other southeast of Tasmania (FR1/94-GC3), extending back 280 kyr BP for the former and 460 kyr BP for the latter. High climatic sensitivity on orbital time scales is observed at both locations, particularly west of New Zealand, where typical glacial/interglacial SST amplitudes always span more than 7 degrees C. Southeast of Tasmania, SST amplitudes are lower in amplitude (4.3 to 6.9 degrees C) with the exception of Termination IV, which involved a SST change over 8 degrees C. The evolution of maximum glacial cooling through time is different at each location. Offshore New Zealand, maximum cooling during glacial stages increases with time, whereas south of Tasmania maximum cooling decreases with time. In addition, our data suggest heterogeneity in the spatial expression of SST during the penultimate and last glacial stages. These glacial periods are recorded differently in both areas, with Marine Isotopic Stage 6 being warmer than Marine Isotopic Stage 2 west of New Zealand, but slightly colder southeast of Tasmania. The area southwest of New Zealand appears susceptible to expansions and contractions of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and/or meridional migrations and changes in intensity of currents associated with the Tasman Front. The region southeast of Tasmania seems more sensitive to thermal changes as seen at high southern latitudes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Downcore records of Th-230-normalized opal (biogenic silica) fluxes from 31 cores in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean were used to compare diatom productivity during the last glacial period to that of the Holocene and to examine the evidence for increased glacial Si export to the tropics. Average glacial opal fluxes south of the modern Antarctic Polar Front (APF) were less than during the Holocene, while average glacial opal fluxes north of the APF were greater than during the Holocene. However, the magnitude of the increase north of the APF was not enough to offset decreased fluxes to the south, resulting in a decrease in opal burial in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean during the last glacial period, equivalent to approximately 15 Gt opal ka(-1). This is consistent with the work of Chase et al. (2003a), and satisfies the primary requirement of the SALH, assuming that the upwelled supply of Si was approximately equivalent during the Holocene and the glacial period. However, previous results from the equatorial oceans are inconsistent with the other predictions of the SALH, namely that either the C-org:CaCO3 ratio or the rate of opal burial should have increased during glacial periods. We compare the magnitudes of changes in the Southern Ocean and the tropics and suggest that Si escaping the glacial Southern Ocean must have had an alternate destination, possibly the continental margins. There is currently insufficient data to test this hypothesis, but the existence of this sink and its potential impact on glacial pCO(2) remain interesting topics for future study.","[Bradtmiller, Louisa I.; Anderson, Robert F.; Fleisher, Martin Q.; Burckle, Lloyd H.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Bradtmiller, Louisa I.; Anderson, Robert F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth \& Environm Sci, New York, NY","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.230042; data\_collection\_article:Geibert, Walter; Rutgers van der Loeff, Michiel M; Usbeck, Regina; Gersonde, Rainer; Kuhn, Gerhard; Seeberg-Elverfeldt, Jens (2005): Quantifying the opal belt in the Atlantic and southeast Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean by means of 230Th normalization.

This study employs an isotopic indicator from microfossils in a diffuse fossil seep for the recognition and characterization of methane seepage in the rock record. Benthic foraminifera from the Pliocene Quinault Formation, western Washington State, are plentiful and provide a temporal link between modem and more ancient seeps. Stable carbon isotope analyses of individual foraminiferal tests revealed a clear distinction between seep and non-seep foraminifera. Infaunal species Globobulimina pacifica and Nonion basispinatum collected from seep samples exhibited delta C-13 values that were highly variable and often strongly depleted: values ranged from -33.1 parts per thousand to - 55.3 parts per thousand PDB in G. Pacifica and from +2.1 parts per thousand to -42.9 parts per thousand PDB in N. basispinatum. The epifaunal species Cibicidoides mckannai, though less depleted, also showed considerable variability with delta C-13 values ranging from +1.7 parts per thousand to -3.1 parts per thousand PDB. In contrast, non-seep specimens were much more enriched and less variable: non-seep specimens of N. basispinatum displayed delta C-13 values clustering between -0.5 parts per thousand and -1.5 parts per thousand PDB, while non-seep specimens of C mckannai yielded a range of +1.1 parts per thousand to +1.8 parts per thousand PDB. SEM analyses and oxygen isotope values of foraminiferal tests indicated minimal diagenetic alteration. delta C-13 values from authigenic blebs (small nodules with wispy, indistinct boundaries) ranged from +8.7 parts per thousand to -38.4 parts per thousand PDB. By combining these inorganic carbonate data with the foraminiferal values, the association of seep-specific bivalves, and the present-day leakage of thermogenic methane from the nearby Garfield gas mound, we conclude that these foraminifera precipitated their tests in the presence of methane-derived carbon. Thus they record pore-water C-13 depletion and syn-depositional fluid-flow pathways near the sediment/ water interface in a seep system active 3.4 mya and continuing onshore and offshore today. The range and degree of C-13 depletion in the Pliocene microfossils is due to the heterogeneity of seepage caused by different methane sources (i.e. thermogenic and biogenic), the tortuosity of fluid migration pathways reaching the seafloor sediments, and mixing of seep fluids with dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and marine organic carbon.

Our statistical analyses of diatom species abundance data indicate that the assemblages dominate open ocean and warm water, coastal water and freshwater masses in the ECS. These proxy species were used to infer the long-term variation in surface hydrological conditions and palaeoclimate. Cycles of ca. 23 ka observed in the relative abundance of the tychopelagic species Paralia sulcata indicate that the increases in precipitation driven by solar insolation might have controlled the diatom assemblages in the ECS. The diatom records also indicate relatively low abundances of tropical, tychopelagic and freshwater species during millennial-scale cold events Such as the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events, which have been well expressed in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere climate. The floral patterns are interpreted as synchronous cooling and more saline sea surface conditions in the ECS caused by the enhanced Asian winter monsoon during the Northern Hemisphere cold events. The higher abundances of tropical species during deglaciation and the Holocene might have been linked to gradual increases in the inflow of the Kuroshio into the Okinawa Trough. The records also suggest a temporary reduction in tropical species from 5 to 3 ka, corresponding to the Pulleniatina Minimum Event during which the warm-water planktic foraminifer Pulleniatina obliquiloculata was rare.

However, thechanges occurred 1-3 Ma earlier in the eastern basin indicating that the northeastern Atlantic led the major change in Pb and Nd isotope composition, probably due to a direct supply of Labrador Seawater via a northern route. The Pb isotope evolution during the Pliocene-Pleistocene can generally be explained by mixing between two end-members corresponding to Mediterranean Outflow Water and North East Atlantic Deep Water, but external sources such as Saharan dust are likely to have played a role as well. The Pb isotope composition of the shallowest crust that grew within the present-day Mediterranean Outflow Water does not show significant Pb isotope changes indicating that it was controlled by the same Pb sources throughout the past 15 Ma.","[Muinos, S.

Reconstructions for Miocene atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration do not give a coherent climatic picture: intervals of ice-free conditions in the Arctic region appear to correspond to low CO2, and intervals during which the Arctic Ocean was ice-covered had high CO2 levels. Here we present the results of climate modelling sensitivity experiments for the Late Miocene, considering different CO2 concentrations. In order to get ice-free conditions in the Arctic Ocean, a CO2 concentration of at least 1500 ppm is necessary. Concentrations this high are unlikely for the Miocene, and our results support onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation earlier than Late Miocene. Compared to future climate change scenarios with enhanced CO2, the modelled temperature response to CO2 increase is slightly weaker in our Miocene sensitivity experiments. This dampened response is due to the decreased sea ice volume in the Miocene and the reduced ice-albedo feedback. Comparing our sensitivity experiments with quantitative terrestrial proxy data to give an estimation for pCO(2) in the Late Miocene we find that model runs with 360 ppm and 460 ppm are most consistent with proxy data. This validation thus suggests that Late Miocene CO2 concentrations were higher than present but lower than 500 ppm.","[Micheels, Arne; Bruch, Angela] Senckenberg Forschungsinst \& Nat Museum, Biodiversitat \& Klima Forschungszentrum LOEWE Bik, Forschungsstelle Role Culture Early Expans Humans, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; AMHERST; C/O WHITEY HAGADORN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, AMHE","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.484677; data\_collection\_article:Bartoli, Gretta; Sarnthein, Michael; Weinelt, Mara; Erlenkeuser, Helmut; Garbe-Sch\""{o}nberg, Dieter; Lea, David W (2005): Final closure of Panama and the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation.

For example it is shown that redistribution of Dubawnt Group sediments is of minor importance after the outburst flood of Lake Agassiz. Paleoproductivity indicators also give insights into paleotemperature trends. These are in phase with terrestrial reconstructions from that area. Colder conditions in Hudson Strait until ca. 4500 cal BP followed by a signal of warmth until ca. 4000 cal BP are suggested. Subsequently, a cool interval lasting until approximately 2000 cal BP occurred.

To understand the ecological preference, and timing and cause(s) of disappearance of S. lepidula, we analysed Neogene record of this taxon from Ocean Drilling Programme and Deep Sea Drilling Project sites located at bathyal to abyssal depths in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Population plots of this species at various sites reveal that this taxon showed a substantial increase during the warm late Oligocene to the middle Miocene and suffered a major decline across the middle Miocene cooling event (15 - 13 Myr). S. lepidula disappeared at similar to 0.6 Myr very close to the MPT (0.9 - 0.8 Myr) from the Indian and Atlantic oceans, coinciding with a change from a 40 to 100 Kyr world with amplified ice-age cycles.

During the Early Pleistocene (Jaramillo subchron), while the calcareous nannofossils experienced their maximal abundance in the subtropical region, they are also found near the Antarctic Divergence. From this interval upwards at the Antarctic Divergence, the calcareous nannofossils decrease in relation to more stable glacial conditions of Antarctica.

Detailed high-resolution sampling permits a new bio-magnetostratigraphic interpretation for ODP Site 1165. A decrease in 6180 values at Sites 1165 and 1167 also occurs at this time, supporting the presence of warming conditions in the Prydz Bay area. A return to colder surface waters, indicated by the absence or rare occurrence of nannofossils in the upper cores from Site 1165, suggests that more stable glacial conditions existed in the Prydz Bay basin, for the last 900 ka. The biogenic carbonate sequence identified at Site 1167 is similar to the carbonate shales recovered from the Cape Roberts Project 1. Both have been dated at about I Ma, supporting the idea that a significant surface waters warming occurred during the Pleistocene.

Elevated smectite contents at the base of Site 1119 (latest Early Pliocene similar to 3.9-3.5 Ma) also occur regionally in the Southern Ocean and point towards an alternative sediment source other than nearby New Zealand terranes. The abrupt reduction in smectite content at similar to 3.5 Ma and replacement by dominant chlorite-illite assemblages corresponds to the onset of Late Pliocene cooling climate conditions and more intense onland physical weathering. High illite contents in Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene (similar to 3.0-1.7 Ma) sediments suggest a more southern terrane (e.g. Haast Schist) source influence and widened shelf conditions. An upward increase in clay content reflects an increased supply of glacier-derived detrital sediment, concurrent with global climate deterioration during the Late Pliocene-Pleistocene.

Proxy evidence indicates that atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher during long warm intervals in the geologic past, and that these conditions did not prevent the precipitation and accumulation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as limestone; accumulation of alkalinity brought to the ocean by rivers kept surface waters supersaturated. But these were steady states, not perturbations. More rapid additions of carbon dioxide during extreme events in Earth history, including the end-permian mass extinction (251 million years ago) and the paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 million years ago) may have driven surface waters to undersaturation, although the evidence supporting this assertion is weak. Neverthless, observations and modeling clearly show that during the PETM the deep ocean, at least, became highly corrosive to CaCO3. These same models applied to modern fossil fuel release project a substantial decline in surface water saturation state in the next century. So, there may be no precedent in Earth history for the type of disruption we might expect from the phenomenally rapid rate of carbon addition associated with fossils fuel burning. As Roger Revelle and Hans Seuss pointed out over 50 years ago, humanity is performing ""the great geophysical experiment"" by pumping vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (Revelle and Seuss, 1957). One result of this experiment is an atmosphere that already contains more carbon dioxide than at any time in last 800,000 years of Earth history (as indicated from the anlysis of bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice; Luthi et al., 2008) and probably more than has occurred in several tens of millions of years (from various marine and terrestrial proxies; Royer, 2006).

Lithology, planktonic foraminiferal distribution and abundances, calcareous plankton and benthic events, and the negative carbon isotope excursion allow precise correlation of the two Shatsky Rise records. Results from quantitative analyses show that Morozovella dominates the assemblages and that its maximum relative abundance is coincident with the lowest delta C-13 values, whereas subbotinids are absent in the interval of maximum abundance of Morozovella. The excursion taxa (Acarinina africana, Acarinina sibaiyaensis, and Morozovella allisonensis) first appear at the base of the event. Comparison between the absolute abundances of whole specimens and fragments of genera demonstrate that the increase in absolute abundance of Morozovella and the decrease of Subbotina are not an artifact of selective dissolution. Moreover, the shefl fragmentation data reveal Subbotina to be the more dissolution-susceptible taxon. The upward decrease in abundance of Morozovella species and the concomitant increase in test size of Morozovella velascoensis are not controlled by dissolution. These changes could be attributed to the species' response to low nutrient supply in the surface waters and to concomitant changes in the physical and chemical properties of the seawater, including increased surface stratification and salinity. Comparison of the planktonic foraminiferal changes at Shatsky Rise to those from other PETM records (Sites 865 and 690) highlights significant similarities, such as the decline of Subbotina at the onset of the event, and discrepancies, including the difference in abundance of the excursion taxa. The observed planktonic foraminifera species response suggests a warmoligotrophic scenario with a high degree of complexity in the ocean structure.

This extinction group (Ext. Gp) exhibited a pulsed decline in abundance and species richness mostly during glacials, and often associated with periods of expansion of polar ice that resulted front increased cooling of the Earth's climate since similar to 2.5 Ma, particularly during the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT, 1.2-0.6 Ma). We infer that the Ext. Gp decline in abundance and disappearance was a result of the increased glacial cooling and consequent increased ventilation of the deep-sea water masses. The detailed record of withdrawal of the Ext. Gp differs between the two sites, with far more disappearances occurring prior to the MPT in the deeper Site 1143 (2772m) than in the shallower Site 1146 (2092 in). The Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene declines in deeper parts of the South China Sea (Site 1143) may have resulted from enhanced glacial production of deep, southern-sourced water passing over the sill into the basin from the North-west Pacific. During the MPT however, the Ext. Gp declines and disappearances were of similar timing and magnitude in both sites, implying that both were influenced by the same deep-water mass during glacials at this time. This could have been North Pacific Deep Water, which many workers infer was formed in the northern Pacific during the last glacial, and may have begun forming during MPT glacials, in association with the progressively enhanced cooling of the Northern Hemisphere.

Previous studies have verified that the Quaternary uplift in this region had a multi-stage character; however geologists have not established which event constituted the main tectonic phase. Fortunately, stratigraphic and paleomagnetic evidence from the Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province, China, now confirm that the Laojunmiao Movement (represented as an angular unconformity) occurred between similar to 0.9 and 0.8 Ma; and an almost synchronous tectonic event has been well recorded within and around the Plateau. Moreover, many proxies indicate that the global climate changed more rapidly after similar to 0.9 Ma. These proxies include eolian loess and vermiculated red soils caused by the Asian monsoon, the eolian sedimentation rate, the Stilostomella extinction, changes in the global thermohaline circulation, and the increased delta C-13 values recorded in the marine sediments. Based on the uplift-driven climate change, the mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) could be the result of the Laojunmiao Movement. Certainly, the Laojunmiao Movement and MPT had the significant impact on the Quaternary earth. We conclude that the Laojunmiao Movement was likely the main tectonic phase of the Quaternary Plateau uplift. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The eight new genera and ten new species more than double the known diversity of fossil beaked whales and represent more than one-third of this family (fossil and extant). A cladistic parsimony analysis based on 18 cranial characters suggested that some of these fossil taxa belong to the three extant ziphiid subfamilies, whereas others might represent extinct ziphild lineages. Such high fossil ziphiid diversity might be linked to the upwelling system and the resulting high productivity of the Benguela Current, which has been in place and influenced conditions of the shallower waters along the southwest coast of South Africa and Namibia since the Middle Miocene. Both fossil and extant South African beaked whale faunas show a wide range in body size, which is probably related to different dietary niches and to wide exploration of the water column. Moreover, most South African fossil ziphiids share two morphological traits with extant species, which indicates that some of the behaviours associated with these traits had likely already developed during the Neogene: 1) the absence of functional maxillary teeth-providing clear evidence of suction feeding; and 2) the heavy ossification of the rostrum in specimens assumed to represent adult males-a feature which likely helps prevent injury and damage on impact during male-male fighting.","[Bianucci, Giovanni] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Post, Klaas] Nat Hist Museum Rotterdam, NL-3001 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lambert, Olivier] Inst Royal Sci Nat Belgique, Dept Paleontol, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; LYNWOOD RIDGE;","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.694040; data\_collection\_article:Udeze, Chioma; Oboh-Ikuenobe, Francisca E (2005): Neogene palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic events inferred from palynological data: Cape Basin off South Africa, ODP Leg 175.

The global cooling steps of the late Pliocene have been documented in numerous studies of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites from the Northern Hemisphere. However, the interactions between oceans and between land and ocean during these cooling steps are poorly known. In particular, data from the Southern Hemisphere are lacking. Therefore I investigated the pollen of ODP Site 1082 in the southeast Atlantic Ocean in order to obtain a high-resolution record of vegetation change in Namibia between 3.4 and 1.8 Ma. Four phases of vegetation development are inferred that are connected to global climate change. ( 1) Before 3 Ma, extensive, rather open grass-rich savannahs with mopane trees existed in Namibia, but the extension of desert and semidesert vegetation was still restricted. ( 2) Increase of winter rainfall dependent Renosterveld-like vegetation occurred between 3.1 and 2.2 Ma connected to strong advection of polar waters along the Namibian coast and a northward shift of the Polar Front Zone in the Southern Ocean. ( 3) Climatically induced fluctuations became stronger between 2.7 and 2.2 Ma and semiarid areas extended during glacial periods probably as the result of an increased pole-equator thermal gradient and consequently globally enhanced atmospheric circulation. ( 4) Aridification and climatic variability further increased after 2.2 Ma, when the Polar Front Zone migrated southward and the influence of Atlantic moisture brought by the westerlies to southern Africa declined. It is concluded that the positions of the frontal systems in the Southern Ocean which determine the locations of the high-pressure cells over the South Atlantic and the southern Indian Ocean have a strong influence on the climate of southern Africa in contrast to the climate of northwest and central Africa, which is dominated by the Saharan low-pressure cell.","Univ Bremen, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.694040; data\_collection\_article:Udeze, Chioma; Oboh-Ikuenobe, Francisca E (2005): Neogene palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic events inferred from palynological data: Cape Basin off South Africa, ODP Leg 175.

The subzones, based on both the acme and highest persistent occurrence of Habibacysta tectata, appear regionally useful within the Lower Pleistocene.

However, their history is often expressed in terms of changes in species richness, a methodology that became suspect with the discovery of cryptic species through molecular techniques. To avoid this problem, I describe the extant coccolithophores in terms of morphostructural characters, tracing their changes through the Neogene. I conclude that these are regulated by a morphological strategy that favors small size of cells and coccoliths. I show that this strategy developed as a result of morphologic convergences in different lineages and in taxa inhabiting different strata of the photic zone. A long-term trend through the Neogene resulted in similar innovations in different lineages, and, also, in the loss of large and complex coccoliths. Superimposed on this trend, a short (similar to 2 m.y.) Pliocene turnover involved both the loss of morphostructural groups that were successful through the Paleogene and Miocene, and a critical, permanent shift to smaller size in the dominant Family Noelaerhabdaceae. The life strategy exhibited by the extant calcareous nannoplankton is rooted in this turnover, so that the same morphological strategy (Pleistocene Morphological Strategy; PLMS) has regulated the coccolithophores since the latest Pliocene-earliest Pleistocene. It is possible that biologic pressure from the microplankton induced the shift to smaller cells; it is equally possible that the progressive change in size and fine structure of coccoliths through the Neogene is linked to an increase in the Mg/Ca ratio and decrease in Ca2+ concentration in what Stanley and Hardie have called Aragonite III sea. The Pliocene turnover was likely induced by glacial intensification in the middle Pliocene, and sustained by the progressive cooling from the warm early Pliocene to the cold Pleistocene. The PLMS thus results from the combined forcing of ocean chemistry and climatic change. The physiognomy of the extant coccolithophores, far from indicating their failure as a result of unfavorable seawater chemistry, demonstrates the remarkable adaptability of a group that evolved and first radiated in Aragonite II sea, thrived in Calcite II sea, and has ""reinvented"" itself in Aragonite III sea by adopting a unique morphological strategy.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; BOULDER; 3300 PENROSE PL, PO BOX 9140, BOULDER, CO 80301 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.694086; data\_collection\_article:Gibbs, Samantha; Young, Jeremy; Bralower, Timothy J; Shackleton, Nicholas J (2007): Nannofossil evolutionary events in the mid-Pliocene: an assessment of the degree of synchrony in the extinctions of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus and Sphenolithus abies.

Clay-rich, hemipelagic sediments of the Paleogene Kilwa Group of coastal Tanzania host calcareous microfossils that are exceptionally preserved, as evidenced by morphological, taxonomic, and geochemical data. The planktonic foraminifera are preserved as glassy, translucent tests with original microgranular wall textures that resemble well-preserved modern specimens, and they arguably yield geochemical values that are relatively unaffected by recrystallization. The calcareous nannofossils are extraordinarily diverse and represented by unique assemblage compositions that include dissolution-susceptible taxa, especially holo-coccoliths and rhabdoliths, and fragile and very small (< 3-mu m) heterococcoliths, many of which are new taxa. Notably, the extant, deep-photic-zone taxon Gladiolithus is documented for the first time in the pre-Quaternary fossil record. The Kilwa Group calcareous nannofossil diversities are consistently higher than all coeval assemblages and provide a benchmark against which to compare other Paleogene biodiversity data. Highest diversities are preserved in hemipelagic, clay-rich lithologies and the greatest losses occur in lithified, carbonate-rich sediments. Most of the lost diversity, however, is confined to distinct taxonomic groups (holococcoliths and Syracosphaerales), and in general the preservational potential of Paleogene coccolithophores was greater than in the modern oceans because a larger proportion of the biodiversity fell within the larger size fractions. For both foraminifera and coccolithophores, incorporation into impermeable clay-rich sediments that have never been deeply buried appears to have been critical in producing this Konservat-Lagerstatte preservation.","[Bown, P.

Based on this model. none of the measured barite samples appear to be in isotopic equilibrium with their parent Solutions, although its predicted they do record lower delta Ca-44/40 values than seawater and calcite. Kinetic fractionation processes therefore most likely control the extent of isotopic fractionation exhibited in barite. Potential fractionation mechanisms include factors influencing Ca2+ substitution for Ba2+ in barite (e.g. ionic strength and trace element concentration of the Solution, competing complexation reactions, precipitation or growth rate, temperature, pressure, and saturation state) as well as nucleation and crystal growth rates. These factors should be considered when investigating controls on isotopic fractionation of Ca2+ and other elements in inorganic and biogenic minerals. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies, focused on oxygen and carbon isotopes over the last decades, are increasingly extending to the emerging calcium isotope system. To date, only little attention has been paid to test the reliability of fossil brachiopods on their modern counterparts. In this context, the present study investigates two modern brachiopods, Terebratulina septentrionalis (eastern Canada, 5-30 m depth, 7.1 degrees C seasonal temperature variation, two-layer shell) and Gryphus vitreus (northern Mediterranean, 200 m depth, constant all-year round temperature, three-layer shell). Both species were sampled along the ontogenetic growth direction and calcium, oxygen, and carbon isotopes as well as elemental concentration were measured. Calcium isotopes were analyzed on TIMS. The elemental composition was analyzed by LA-ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The results indicate an intra-specimen delta Ca-44/40 variation ranging from 0.16 to 0.33\%, pointing to a fairly homogenous distribution of calcium isotopes in brachiopod shells. However, in the light of the suggested 0.7 parts per thousand increase in calcium isotopes over the Phanerozoic such intra-specimen variations constrain ocean reconstruction. delta Ca-44/40 values of T septentrionalis do not seem to be affected by growth rate. Calcium isotopic values of G. vitreus are heavy in the central part of the shell and trend towards lighter values in peripheral areas approaching the maximum isotopic composition of T septentrionalis. The maximum inter-species delta Ca-44/40 difference of 0.62 parts per thousand between T septentrionalis and G. vitreus indicates that care should be taken when using different taxa, species with different strontium content or brachiopods with specialized shell structure, such as G. vitreus, for ocean water reconstruction in terms of Ca isotopic composition. T septentrionalis may record Ca isotopic fractionation related to seasonal seawater temperature variations in its shell but this is difficult to resolve at the current analytical precision. Average delta O-18-derived temperatures of the two investigated species are close to on-site measured temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is now well recognized that the low biological productivity in this region is mainly due to the limitation of phytoplankton growth by iron. However, in the core of the Southern Ocean, a massive bloom occurs annually above the Kerguelen Plateau. In the context of KEOPS (Kerguelen Plateau and Ocean compared Study) we investigated the three-dimensional distribution of dissolved iron (DFe) concentrations southeast of the island. We show that in surface waters, DFe was low and not significantly different above and outside the plateau (0.090+/-0.034 and 0.073+/-0.014 nM, respectively). By contrast, below 150 in major differences in vertical profiles of DFe were observed. The deep waters above the plateau were clearly enriched, with DFe concentrations up to 0.6 nM near the seafloor. The regeneration from sinking biogenic material and the input from the sediments are very likely the major processes delivering DFe to the deep water. The deep iron-rich reservoir existing above the plateau was responsible for the natural iron fertilization of the surface water by two different mechanisms: (i) winter mixing provided 5 times more DFe to the surface waters above the plateau than outside and (ii) enhanced vertical gradients of DFe and elevated vertical diffusivity resulted in an 8-fold higher diapycnal diffusive flux. The natural iron fertilization presented major differences from artificial iron-fertilization experiments carried out in the Southern Ocean. The amount of DFe required to stimulate the biological activity is much less and the mode of addition is clearly different. The quantification of the excess of DFe supplied in the naturally fertilized area leads to the conclusion that the natural iron fertilization is 10-150 times more efficient to export carbon below 200 in than in artificial fertilization experiments. The bloom above the Kerguelen Plateau was contingent to iron fertilization but it was also sustained by continuous input of major nutrients. Thus, the natural fertilization described here mimics quite well glacial period scenarios where iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean might have occurred from below. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Dorsey et al. (1997b) argued that delta progradation and transgression cycles in the basin were driven by episodic fault-controlled subsidence along the basin-bounding Loreto fault. Here we test this hypothesis by a detailed analysis of the sedimentary architecture of 11 exceptionally well-exposed, vertically arranged fluvio-deltaic PUs, each of which shows lateral facies transition from proximal alluvial facies palaeo-seaward into distal pro-delta facies. Of these 11 PUs, seven exhibit a lateral transition from a shoal water to Gilbert-delta facies associations as they are traced palaeo-seaward. This transition is characterised by down-transport development of foresets, which grow in height up to 35 m. Foreset units thicken in a basinward direction, with initially an oblique topset-foreset geometry that becomes increasingly sigmoidal. Each delta is capped by a shell bed that records drowning of the delta top. This systematic transition in delta architecture records increasing water depth through time during individual episodes of progradation. A mechanism that explains this transition is an accelerating rate of fault-controlled subsidence during each PU. During episodes of low slip rate, shoal-water deltas prograde across the submerged topography of the underlying delta unit. As displacement rate accelerates, increasing bathymetry at the delta front leads to steepening of foresets and initiation of Gilbert deltas. Subsequent delta drowning results from sediment starvation at the shoreline at high slip rates because of sediment trapping upstream. The observed delta architecture suggests that the long-term (> 100 kyr) history of slip on the Loreto fault was characterised by repetitive episodes of accelerating displacement accumulation. Such episodic fault behaviour is most likely to be because of variations in temporal and spatial strain partitioning between the Loreto fault and other faults in the Gulf of California. A physical explanation for the acceleration phenomenon involves evolving frictional properties on the episodically active Loreto fault.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Inst Earth Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol \& Med, Dept Earth Sci \& Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

The lithostratigraphical study allowed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental conditions during the existence of a palaeo-marsh. Based on tephrostratigraphical analysis, the significant volcanoclastic inputs recorded along the Sessano succession were correlated to the explosive activity of the nearby Roccamonfina volcano and in particular to the high-K series (HKS) period of activity, lasted from 546 to 364 ka. The Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 437.9 +/- 1.9 ka obtained at the base of the trench section, which stratigraphically overlaps the core succession, confirms the tephrostratigraphical model and indicates that the marsh dried up during the glacial phase of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12. On this basis, the glacial-interglacial cycle recognised in the core through pollen analysis was ascribed to MIS 14 and 13, while the interglacial phase identified at the core base was tentatively ascribed to MIS 15. The duration of the marshy phase was estimated between 130 and 150 ka. The floral composition of the pollen spectra shows a more modern character with respect to coeval pollen records from Campania, confirming that the heterochronous disappearance of the last subtropical elements from Italy had a latitudinal character.

From our molecular analyses and morphological evidence, we concluded that this genus contains three species; Z. otis, Z. oxleyi and Z. emelina. The status of the latter species is revised, while Z. labradus and Z. antanossa, which were formerly treated as specifically distinct, are regarded as subspecies of Z. otis. Based on our analyses, we also employ phylogeography to discuss possible speciation events in the genus. Each of the three Zizina species appears to have branched from the common ancestor, with a divergence time estimated to be about 2.5 million years ago. The ancestors of Z. oxleyi and Z. emelina are postulated to have adapted to a temperate climate, diverged in the northern and southern hemispheres, and resulted in the extant species from New Zealand and East Asia, respectively. In contrast, the ancestor of Z. otis adapted mainly to tropical and subtropical zones, and the extant Z. otis dispersed into the Afrotropical, Oriental and Australian regions. Feeding adaptations in the larvae also might have had an effect on speciation within Zizina. In addition, our results indicated that there is a possibility that the distribution of the New Zealand Z. oxleyi was reduced in extent by the introduction of Z. otis, which immigrated recently from Australia or its surroundings.","[Yago, Masaya; Ueshima, Rei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lab Evolut Systemat,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Hirai, Norio; Tanikawa, Tetsuo; Ishii, Minoru] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life \& Environ Sci, Entomol Lab, Naka Ku, Osaka 5998","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.704257; data\_collection\_article:Lisiecki, Lorraine E; Raymo, Maureen E (2005): A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records.

Improvements include software that controls the measurement procedures and a video camera that remotely records the reaction of the samples under BrF5 with a CO2 laser. Maximum safety is guaranteed as the laser-fluorination unit is arranged under a fume hood in a separate room from the operator. A new routine has been developed for removing the exchangeable hydrous components within biogenic silica using ramp degassing. The sample plate is heated up to 1100 degrees C and cooled down to 400 degrees C in 7 h under a flow of He gas (the inert Gas Flow Dehydration method - iGFD) before isotope analysis. Two quartz and two biogenic silica samples (similar to 4.5 mg) of known isotope composition were tested. The isotopic compositions were reproducible within an acceptable error; quartz samples gave a mean standard deviation of <0.15 parts per thousand (1(sigma) and for biogenic silica <0.25 parts per thousand (1(sigma) for samples down to similar to 0.3 mg.

The data from Site 219 was combined with published foraminiferal and isotope data from Site 214, eastern Indian Ocean to determine the nature of changes. Factor and cluster analyses of the 28 highest-ranked species distinguished four biofacies, characterizing distinct deep-sea environmental settings. These biofacies have been named after their most dominant species such as Stilostomella lepidula-Pleurostomella alternans (Sl-Pa), Nuttallides umbonifer-Globocassidulina subglobosa (Nu-Gs), Oridorsalis umbonatus-Gavelinopsis lobatulus (Ou-Gl) and Epistominella exigua-Uvigerina hispido-costata (Ee-Uh) biofacies.

The proxy record indicates fluctuating tropical environmental conditions such as oxygenation, surface productivity and organic food supply. These changes appear to have been driven by changes in monsoonal wind intensity related to glacial-interglacial cycles. A shift at similar to 1.2-0.9 Myr is observed in both the faunal and isotope records at Site 219, indicating a major increase in monsoon-induced productivity.

Our approach is to estimate a non-linear transfer function between past sea level and delta O-18(b) over the last two glacial cycles, with additional information from the mid-Pliocene. Combining this transfer function with the relationship between temperature and delta O-18(b) permits a deconvolution Of a delta O-18(b) record from the deep Pacific into its temperature and sea-level constituents over the course of the Plio-Pleistocene. This deconvolution indicates that deep Pacific temperature is stable through much of the last glacial (MISs 4 through 2) and then increases by approximately 2 degrees C during the last deglaciation. This pattern of variability appears to generally be replicated every glacial cycle back to the mid-Pliocene, suggesting a pulse of warming in the deep Pacific on a similar to 100 kyr time scale during the late Pleistocene. Thus, according to this partition, there is more similar to 100 kyr variability in temperature than in ice variability. Spectral analysis reveals that this variability is likely the product of multiple obliquity cycles rather than a simple 100-kyr signal. The non-linear behaviour of deep ocean temperature, dominated by pulses at 100 kyr time scales, may identify it as a key player in governing the glacial cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, compound-specific hydrogen isotope analysis of individual alkenones has not been possible due to chromatographic coelution of alkenones with the same carbon chain length but different numbers of double bonds. Published studies have only reported the delta D values of the mixture of coeluting alkenones. We developed an efficient procedure to isolate individual alkenones based on double-bond numbers using silica gel impregnated with silver nitrate. The chromatographic procedure is simple, inexpensive, and highly reproducible, offers 87-100\% sample recovery, and allows for the first time hydrogen isotopic measurement on individual alkenones. delta D values of specific di-, tri- and tetraunsaturated C-37 alkenones produced by an Emiliania huxleyi culture, as well as those isolated from Greenland lake sediments, differ consecutively by 43-65 \%. These findings suggest that alkenones with different numbers of carbon-carbon double bonds express significantly different delta D values and that coelution of different alkenones may lead to erroneous source water delta D reconstructions.

As revealed by productivity-related proxies, BUS intensification led to a major transition in regional biological productivity when considering the termination of the Matuyama Diatom Maximum (a diatom high-production event). Major oceanic reorganization in the Benguela was accompanied by nutrient source changes, as indicated by a new nitrogen isotopic (delta N-15) record that revealed a stepwise increase at ca. 2.4 and ca. 1.5 Ma ago.

In contrast, our new submillennial-scale paleoceanographic records from the Pliocene North Atlantic suggest a far more precise timing and forcing for the initiation of northern hemisphere glaciation (NHG), since it was linked to a 2-3 degrees C surface water warming during warm stages from 2.95 to 2.82 Ma. These records support previous models [G.H. Haug, R. Tiedemann, Effect of the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation, Nature 393 (1998) 673-676.[2]] claiming that the final closure of the Panama Isthmus (3.0- similar to 2.5 Ma [J. Groeneveld S. Steph, R. Tiedemann, D. Nurnberg, D. Garbe-Schonberg, The final closure of the Central American Seaway, Geology, in prep. [3]]) induced an increased poleward salt and heat transport. Associated strengthening of North Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation and in turn, an intensified moisture supply to northern high latitudes resulted in the build-up of NHG, finally culminating in the great, irreversible ""climate crash"" at marine isotope stage G6 (2.74 Ma). In summary, there was a two-step threshold mechanism that marked the onset of NHG with glacial-to-interglacial cycles quasi-persistent until today. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Sampled vent fluids show a wide range of absolute REE concentrations and chondrite-normalized (REEN) distribution patterns (La-N/Sm-N similar to 0.6-11; La-N/Yb-N similar to 0.6-71; Eu-N/Eu-N* similar to 1-55). REEN distribution patterns in different vent fluids range from light-REE enriched, to mid- and heavy-REE enriched, to flat, and have a range of positive Eu-anomalies. This heterogeneity contrasts markedly with relatively uniform REEN distribution patterns of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal fluids. In Manus Basin fluids, aqueous REE compositions do not inherit directly or show a clear relationship with the REE compositions of primary crustal rocks with which hydrothermal fluids interact. These results suggest that the REEs are less sensitive indicators of primary crustal rock composition despite crustal rocks being the dominant source of REEs in submarine hydrothermal fluids. In contrast, differences in aqueous REE compositions are consistently correlated with differences in fluid pH and ligand (chloride, fluoride and sulfate) concentrations. Our results suggest that the REEs can be used as an indicator of the type of magmatic acid volatile (i.e., presence of HF, SO2) degassing in submarine hydrothermal systems. Additional fluid data suggest that near-seafloor mixing between high-temperature hydrothermal fluid and locally entrained seawater at many vent areas in the Manus Basin causes anhydrite precipitation. Anhydrite effectively incorporates REE and likely affects measured fluid REE concentrations, but does not affect their relative distributions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposits on James Ross Island (northern Antarctic Peninsula) constrain the depositional setting, ice-bed dynamics and regional palaeoclimate. The sequences on James Ross Island vary in age but are mainly late Miocene and Pliocene. Unlike Neogene sedimentary sequences elsewhere in Antarctica, those on James Ross Island are unusually well-dated by a combination of Ar-40/Ar-39 and Sr-87/Sr-86 analyses on fresh interbedded lavas and pristine bivalve molluscs, respectively. The Sr isotopic ages of the debris flows cluster around 4.74, 4.89, 5.44, 5.78, and 6.31 Ma and probably date relatively warm periods in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, when the bivalves lived under ice-poor or seasonally ice-free conditions. The bivalves are often remarkably well-preserved, lack adhering lithified sediment and, in at least two locations, are large, mainly unfragmented and sometimes articulated, suggesting that they were alive immediately prior to their incorporation in subaqueous debris flows at the margins of an advancing glacier. These fossiliferous glacigenic debris flows signify episodes of ice expansion during relatively warm periods, or ""interglacials"", of the late Miocene and Pliocene. The James Ross Island glacigenic sedimentary successions attain thicknesses of up to 150 in and extend over 4 km laterally. The high volume of glacigenic sediment delivery implicit in the James Ross Island successions indicates that a series of dynamic ice fronts crossed the region during the late Miocene and Pliocene epochs. Associated evidence, in the form of clast abrasion (including striations and faceting) and bedrock erosion, is indicative of basal sliding and subglacial sediment deformation active at the ice-bed interface and wet-based temperate or polythermal regimes, prior to remobilisation. The evidence further suggests two local ice caps on James Ross Island during the warm periods, as well as ice-overriding by the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet from the west and northwest.

NRM and magnetic susceptibility (X) display a positive linear correlation (R-2 = 0.81) and reach very high values up to 121 A/m and 148 x 10(-3) SI. Although a Curie temperature of 580 degrees C and a Verwey transition at about -160 degrees C is indicative of magnetite, (X)-T heating experiments in argon and air atmosphere and thermal demagnetization measurements of NRM revealed a slight cation-deficiency. According to induced remanent magnetization experiments the remanence is carried solely by this low coercive phase. Minor titanomaghemite with a T-C at about 340 degrees C only occurs in samples with larger oxide grains (20-80 mu m). High vesicle abundances and the exsolution texture of Fe-Ti oxides suggest subaerial extrusion of the lava. A high oxygen fugacity (probably above the NNO buffer) and a low Ti/Ti + Fe) ratio of the basaltic melt are suggested as a precondition for high concentration of magnetic minerals and therefore high primary TRM. During high temperature oxidation, ilmenite exsolution-lamellae, developed in titanomagnetite, and symplectic magnetite (+ pyroxene) formed by the breakdown of olivine. This secondary magnetite, grown at temperatures above the Curie temperature, increases the primary TRM. Early stage hydrothermal alteration (below about 375 degrees C) led to maghemitization of (titano)magnetite, clearly indicated by shrinkage cracks and irreversible (X)-T curves. During later stage hydrothermal alteration, NRM intensity increased slightly due to the growth of secondary magnetite at lower temperatures (about 250-300 degrees C). This hydrothermally formed magnetite acquired only a low CRM but increased magnetic susceptibility significantly. According to our results it is suggested, that hydrothermal alteration does not necessarily lower remanent magnetization, but contributes to an increase in magnetization. The interplay of the three factors melt composition, small grain sizes of secondary magnetite due to decomposition of silicates and new formation under hydrothermal conditions caused the strong magnetic anomaly at the surface.

In order to better understand STD data of oceanic basalts, and to possibly identify the magnetominerals that are carrying the NRM, we have carried out a number of continuous and STD experiments on seven oceanic basalt samples. During continuous thermal demagnetization (CTD), a sample is heated to a certain temperature and its NRM is measured during heating and subsequent cooling. Even when CTD reveals only titanomaghemite unblocking at 400 degrees C as the remanence carrier, STD behaviour can be very complex and unblocking is observed at temperatures of up to 500 degrees C and higher. CTD also allowed to identify a partial or full self-reversal of NRM due to interaction between two types of magnetominerals in one sample. The higher degree of maghemitization of smaller titanomaghemite grains with respect to larger ones, which are less efficient in carrying the remanence, was seen for three samples by a shift of 80 degrees C between the strong field thermomagnetic curve and the NRM measured at elevated temperature. In several cases, the identification of the NRM-carrying magnetomineral was not possible from CTD data due to the ambiguity of Curie temperatures in the titanomagnetite/titanomaghemite system.","Univ Munich, D-80333 Munich, Germany; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.711520; data\_collection\_article:Wang, Daming; Van der Voo, Rob; Peacor, Donald R (2005): Why is the remanent magnetic intensity of Cretaceous MORB so much higher than that of mid to late Cenozoic MORB?.

Science 292, 2453-2458), ages exceeding 8200 calendar yr BP are likely to represent minimum values. Ages postdating this limit, which are less affected by variations of atmospheric radiocarbon concentration. indicate the presence of a post-8200 calendar yr BP cold event meltwater pulse caused by eustatic sea-level rise from approximately 40 in below present to the present level by about 6000 calendar yr BP. Inaccuracies of the pre-8200 calendar yr BP radiocarbon ages may be attributed to large variations of atmospheric Delta(14)C during the postglacial period with greenhouse gases released from the sub-aerially exposed continental shelf probably accounting for a significant proportion.

Such mound structures are found at several locations along the continental margin but are especially numerous off Ireland. All rooted on a common unconformity (RD1) and embedded in drift sediments, the mounds in the Porcupine Seabight remain enigmatic structures, and their initial trigger and formation mechanisms are still not entirely clear. This paper discusses the sedimentary environment during the initial stages of Challenger Mound, and at the start-up of the embedding sediment drift. The results are interpreted within the regional palaeo-environmental context. Based on detailed grain-size analyses and planktonic foraminifera assemblage counts, a 14-m interval overlying the regional base-of-mound unconformity RD1 is characterised at IODP Sites U1317 (on mound), U1316 (off mound), and U1318 (background site). Several sedimentary facies are identified and interpreted in relation to regional current dynamics. Using the foraminifera counts, existing age models for the initial stages of on-mound and off-mound sedimentation are refined. Sedimentation within the initial mound was characterised by a two-mode system, with the observed cyclicities related to glacial/interglacial stages. However, the contrast in environmental conditions between the stages was less extreme than observed in the most recent glacial/interglacial cycles, allowing continuous cold-water coral growth. This sustained presence of coral framework was the key factor for fast mound build-up, baffling sediments at periods of slack currents, and protecting them from renewed erosion during high-current events. The off-mound and background sedimentation consisted mainly of a succession of contourite beds, ranging from sandy contourites in the initial stages to muddy contourites higher up in the sequence, representing the true onset of drift sedimentation. The latter illustrate the increasing importance of glacial conditions after the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution. The overall findings are summarised in a descriptive conceptual model.

The stability mechanism of its pH has been interpreted in terms of the buffering dissolution/formation reaction of CaCO3 as well as the proton consumption/generation reaction in CaCO3-saturated water. Here the pH-dependent solubility product [HCO3-][Ca2+] has been derived on the basis of the actual pH-dependent reactions for the atmospheric CO2/CO2(aq.)/ HCO3-/CO32-/Ca2+/CaCO3 system. Overbasic pH peaks appeared between pH approximate to 8 and approximate to 9.5 during sodium hydroxide titration, as a result of simultaneous CaCO3 formation and proton generation. The spontaneous and prompt water pH recovery from the acidic to the physiological range has been confirmed by the observation of acid/base time evolution, because of simultaneous CaCO3 dissolution and proton consumption. The dissolution/formation of CaCO3 in water at pH 7.5 - 9 does not take place without a proton consumption/generation reaction, or a buffering chemical reaction of HCO3-+Ca2+=CaCO3+H+. SEM images of the CaCO3 fragments showed that the acid water ate away at the CaCO3 formed at physiological pH values. Natural coral reefs can thus recover the physiological pH levels of seawater from the acidic range through partial dissolution of their own skeletons.","[Ichikawa, Kazuhiko] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; WEINHEIM; PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.712921; data\_collection\_article:H\""{o}nisch, B\""{a}rbel; Hemming, N Gary (2005): Surface ocean pH response to variations in pCO2 through two full glacial cycles.

Early Eocene tectonic subsidence linked to Pyrenean orogenesis created the Ainsa basin, with water depths of similar to 400-800 m above a foundered shallow-marine mixed carbonate and clastic shelf. The similar to 25 sandbodies or channelized submarine fans in the basin were controlled by the similar to 400 k.y. Milankovitch frequency, with modes at similar to 100 k.y. and similar to 41 k.y. (possibly stacked similar to 23k.y.) influencing bottom-water conditions in the basin, causing periodic stratification in the water column across a submarine sill at the western basin margin (early Boltana anticline). Intrabasinal tectonics defined and controlled the position of eight sandy systems and their constituent fans, in a process of seesaw tectonics, by (1) westward lateral offset stacking of sandy fans due to growth of the eastern side of the basin, represented today by the Mediano anticline, and (2) eastward (orogenward) back stepping of the depositional axis of each sandy system, due to phases of relative uplift of the Boltana anticline. During basin infill, uplift of the Boltana anticline led to increasing basin narrowing and depositional confinement. Unlike the earlier depositional systems, the youngest deep-marine system was fed from a more southern sediment source between the growth anticlines, as was the overlying deltaic system. All the older deep-marine sandy systems were fed from southeast point sources, from canyons and erosional lower-slope channels eroding the growing Mediano anticline. The depositional style outlined in this paper might be common to other active margins where siliciclastic basins evolve between active thrusts.","[Pickering, Kevin T.; Bayliss, Nicole J.] UCL, Dept Earth Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; BOULDER; PO BOX 9140, BOULDER, CO 80301-9140 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.720961; data\_collection\_article:Pekar, Stephen F; Hucks, Audrey; Fuller, Michael D; Li, Shawna (2005): Glacioeustatic changes in the early and middle Eocene (51-42 Ma): Shallow-water stratigraphy from ODP Leg 189 Site 1171 (South Tasman Rise) and deep-sea d18O records.

The identification of magnetic polarity was possible at 51 horizons, whereby four magnetozones were recognized. These magnetozones were correlatable to geomagnetic polarity chrons C31r to C30n, suggesting that the age of the Senpohshi Formation is spanning from middle to upper part of the Maastrichtian (ca. 69-67 Ma). The magnetostratigraphy of the Senpohshi Formation established in this study enables a direct age correlation to the Maastrichtian successions in other regions. Thus, this detailed chronology of the formation contributes to paleontological studies of the Maastrichtian in the North Pacific region. For instance, this magnetostratigraphic age assessment implies the following: (1) the stratigraphic range of the ammonite Pachydiscus flexuosus contains polarity chrons from the lower part of C31r to the lower part of C31n, (2) the first occurrence (FO) of the calcareous nannofossil Nephrolithus frequens in the North Pacific region is correlatable to polarity chron C30n or below, and (3) the FO of the bivalve ""Inoceramus"" awajiensis is located within polarity chrons from C31r to the upper part of C31n. This suggests that the inoceramid extinction event in the North Pacific region might have occurred during polarity chrons from C31r to the upper part of C31n (ca. 70.5-67.8 Ma), which is 2.3-5.0 Myr prior to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The trend of the Maastrichtian faunal turnover in the North Pacific is well consistent with those of other regions, brings a new evidence for understanding the global faunal turnover in the Maastrichtian, just before Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction.

The silicic rocks can be divided into two groups. Group I consists of transitional icelandite dikes and icelandite to basaltic icelandite lava flows that follow a tholeiitic liquid line of descent. Group II includes the Mauna Kuwale Rhyodacite and several intermediate-silica lavas that follow a K-rich, calc-alkaline evolutionary trend. Group II lavas are highly porphyritic, with biotite and hornblende in the rhyodacites, and are selectively enriched in Rb, U and Pb. Pb, Sr and Nd isotope ratios of a Group I dike are similar to those of other Wai'anae basaltic samples, whereas Group II lavas have lower Pb-206/ Pb-204, Pb-207/ Pb-204, and epsilon(Nd), and high ratios of radiogenic Pb-208*/Pb-206*, similar to some lavas from Ko'olau, L (a) over bar na'i, and Kaho'olawe volcanoes. Most Group I dikes define a trend consistent with fractional crystallization at similar to 0 center dot 5 kbar with low initial water (0 center dot 3 wt \%) contents, whereas the chemical trends for Group II samples cannot be reproduced by simple crystallization models. These results, together with trace element modeling and isotopic characteristics, suggest derivation of the Group II silicic flows by hydrous melting of lower Hawaiian crust that had been altered to amphibolite. Crustal melting toward the end of the shield stage may be related to an increase in lithostatic pressure following rapid accumulation of lavas in the shield stage and ponding of basaltic magmas at depths below the level of crack closure (similar to 9-10 km). Contemporaneously, Group I silicic magmas formed by shallow-level crystallization as a consequence of decreased magma supply to the upper crust as a result of waning activity at the end of the shield stage. Geochemical evidence indicates significant mixing between the different types of silicic magma and between basaltic and silicic magmas at this stage of volcano evolution. Although melting of recycled crustal material entrained in the upwelling Hawaiian plume has previously been proposed, this is the first documentation of a role for melting of lower Hawaiian crust in the genesis of Hawaiian volcanoes.","[Van Der Zander, I.] Environm Sci Int Inc, Kailua, HI 96734 USA; [Sinton, J.

Laminated diatom mat deposits record episodes of massive flux of the diatom Thalassiothrix antarctica beneath the Antarctic Polar Front and provide a marker for tracking the migration of the Front through time. Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1091, 1093 and 1094 are the only deep piston cored record hitherto sampled from the sediments of the circumpolar biogenic opal belt. Mapping of diatom mat deposits between these sites indicates a glacial-interglacial front migration of up to 6 degrees of latitude in the early/mid Pleistocene. The mid-Pleistocene transition marks a stepwise minimum 7 degrees northward migration of the locus of the Polar Front sustained for about 450 kyr until an abrupt southward return to a locus similar to its modern position and further south than any mid-Pleistocene locus. This interval from a ""900 ka event"" that saw major cooling of the oceans and a delta C-13 minimum through to the 424 ka Mid-Brunhes Event at Termination V is also seemingly characterised by 1) sustained decreased carbonate in the sub-tropical south Atlantic, 2) reduced strength of Antarctic deep meridional circulation. 3) lower interglacial temperatures and lower interglacial atmospheric CO2 levels (by some 30 per mil) than those of the last 400 kyr, evidencing less complete deglaciation. This evidence is consistent with a prolonged period lasting 450 kyr of only partial ventilation of the deep ocean during interglacials and suggests that the mechanisms highlighted by recent hypotheses linking mid-latitude atmospheric conditions to the extent of deep ocean ventilation and carbon sequestration over glacial-interglacial cycles are likely in operation during the longer time scale characteristic of the mid-Pleistocene transition. The cooling that initiated the ""900 ka event"" may have been driven by minima in insolation amplitude related to eccentricity modulation of precession that also affected low latitude climates as marked by threshold changes in the African monsoon system. The major thresholds in earth system behaviour through the mid-Pleistocene transition were likely governed by an interplay of the 100 kyr and 400 kyr eccentricity modulation of precession.

The relevant findings are these: large regular changes in climate occurred within the last million years, especially in the northern North Atlantic. Extreme conditions were similar, suggesting strong negative feedback at the edges of the range of variation. The nature of the periods of climate variation suggests orbital forcing by modulation of internal oscillations involving lagged negative feedback on ice buildup. Transitions from cold to warm were rapid and they were not readily reversed, indicating that ice dynamics underlies abrupt climate change. Accelerated rates of ice decay upon warming correspond to a sea-level rise of one to two m/century. Millennial-scale abrupt disturbances known as ""Dansgaard-Oeschger'' and ""Heinrich'' Events occur when large ice masses are present in the northern hemisphere. They may be considered experiments on the ocean's response to massive meltwater input. When using results from ice-age studies to project future developments, one must be aware that the future will be largely outside of experience with regard to the recent geologic past. Also, there are as yet no generally accepted explanations for striking changes in the past, such as the rapid rise of carbon dioxide during deglaciation, demonstrating a profound lack of understanding of climate dynamics. This is, so far, the lesson from ice-age studies: they say much about the deficiencies in our level of understanding, and not so much about what is ahead.","[Schulz, Michael; Wefer, Gerold] Univ Bremen, MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Schulz, Michael; Wefer, Gerold] Univ Bremen, Fachbereich Geowissensch, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Berger, Wolfgang H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 9","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

A stronger organic carbon pump and therefore lower rain ratios of CaCO3 to organic carbon may have contributed to the low atmospheric CO2 content during the Last Glacial Maximum. Previous study of temperature-dependent export production ( Laws et al., 2000) and our map of data-based, global distribution of the rain ratios lend support to today's rain ratios being controlled at least partly by temperature. A close examination with a high-resolution regional ocean ecosystem model indicates that the correlation between rain ratio and temperature is caused indeed by preferential remineralization of organic matter, but a part of the correlation is also driven by temperature-dependent community composition. An extrapolation of these results to the globe using a global carbon cycle box model with a module for sediments indicates that the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 by the proposed mechanism is approximately 30 ppm. While this estimate is subject to uncertainty, the fact that it represents nearly one third of the glacial-interglacial variation in atmosphere pCO(2) suggests the potential importance of the new mechanism. Given the historical difficulty in explaining the full CO2 amplitude with a single cause, we suggest that a set of multiple mechanisms were responsible and that the temperature-dependent POC degradation rate is one of them. We discuss two possible difficulties with our proposal that have to do with the potentially important role that ballasts play in organic carbon export and the possibility that enhanced biological pump is self limiting.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol \& Geophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; Frontier Res Syst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

Although the three C3 species, on average, grew 60\% faster than the three CAM species, the two groups did not significantly differ in their CO2 response. The two Orchidaceae, Bulbophyllurn (CAM) and Oncidium (C3) showed no CO2 response, and three out of four Bromeliaceae showed a positive one: Aechmea (CAM, +32\% p = 0.08), Catopsis (C3, +11\% p = 0.01) and Vriesea (C3, +4\% p = 0.02). In contrast, the representative of the species-rich genus Tillandsia (CAM), which grew very well under experimental conditions, showed no stimulation.

Core MD03-2699 is the first high-resolution mid-Brunhes record from the North Atlantic's eastern boundary upwelling system covering the complete MIS 11c interval and MIS 13. The array of sites reflect western and eastern basin boundary current as well as north to south transect sampling of subpolar and transitional water masses and allow the reconstruction of transport pathways in the upper limb of the North Atlantic's circulation. Hydrographic conditions in the surface and deep ocean during peak interglacial MIS 9 and 11 were similar among all the sites with relative stable conditions and confirm prolonged warmth during MIS 11c also for the mid-latitudes. Sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions further reveal that in the mid-latitude North Atlantic MIS 11c is associated with two plateaus, the younger one of which is slightly warmer. Enhanced subsurface northward heat transport in the eastern boundary current system, especially during early MIS 11c, is denoted by the presence of tropical planktic foraminifer species and raises the question how strongly it impacted the Portuguese upwelling system. Deep water ventilation at the onset of MIS 11c significantly preceded surface water ventilation. Although MIS 13 was generally colder and more variable than the younger interglacials the surface water circulation scheme was the same. The greatest differences between the sites existed during the glacial inceptions and glacials. Then a north - south trending hydrographic front separated the nearshore and offshore waters off Portugal. While offshore waters originated from the North Atlantic Current as indicated by the similarities between the records of IODP Site U1313, ODP Site 980 and MD01-2446, nearshore waters as recorded in core MD03-2699 derived from the Azores Current and thus the subtropical gyre.

In this study, we examine results for 601 samples from 331 depths measured by 1994, and 92 samples from 46 depths newly measured in 2006. Poorly replicated samples, samples with no replicates and samples falling more than three standard deviations from the mean of each delta O-2/N-2 data set are excluded from the analysis. The majority of poorly replicated samples are from the depth zone associated with the transition between gas in bubbles and gas present as clathrate hydrates. We found that the O-2/N-2 ratio of samples is depleted by an average value of 7.3\% during 11 years of storage at -35 degrees C O-2/N-2 ratios measured at various times were corrected for depletion during storage and combined to form a single data set. The stacked GISP2 delta O-2/N-2 record shows strong spectral power at the orbital frequencies, and delta O-2/N-2 is in antiphase with local summer insolation. This observation is consistent with the earlier findings for the Vostok and Dome Fuji ice cores from East Antarctica. It validates previous conclusions that fractionation during bubble close-off depends on ice grain properties set at the surface by solar insolation. In addition, the GISP2 delta O-2/N-2 record shows millennial duration signals that are in phase with the local temperature record of rapid climate change. The exact mechanisms by which local summer insolation induces orbital variability in delta O-2/N-2, and by which temperature ( or related properties) induce high frequency signals in delta O-2/N-2, remain to be identified.","[Bender, Michael L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

It has been difficult to compare the periods, however, because of the long duration of Stage 11 and a lack of detailed knowledge of any extreme climate events that may have occurred. Here we use the distinctive phasing between seasurface temperatures and the oxygen-isotope records of benthic foraminifera in the southeast Atlantic Ocean to stratigraphically align the Holocene interglacial with the first half of the Marine Isotope Stage 11 interglacial optimum. This alignment suggests that the second half of Marine Isotope Stage 11 should not be used as a reference for 'pre-anthropogenic' greenhouse-gas emissions. By compiling benthic carbon-isotope records from sites in the Atlantic Ocean on a single timescale, we also find that meridional overturning circulation strengthened about 415,000 years ago, at a time of high orbital obliquity.

However, the relationship between tropical and sub-tropical monsoonal variations and high northern latitude ice sheet expansion as well as processes such as late Pliocene tropical sea surface temperature (SST) change is not clear. Our late Pliocene (2.5-3.3 Ma) monsoon proxy records and Mg/Ca derived SST records at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1143 from the southern South China Sea (SCS) reveal that while tropical SST shows a stepwise decrease of 2-3 degrees C during this period, the East Asian monsoon gradually strengthens in response to the onset of the NHG. At the 41-kyr and 23-kyr bands, ice volume change lags tropical SST by similar to 4 kyr, but leads the East Asian monsoon by similar to 12-17 kyr. Our finding highlights the significant role of the tropical Pacific region in driving global climate change in the late Pliocene, which has invariable leading phase relative to the ice volume change as in the late Pleistocene. However, the East Asian monsoon shows a linear response to the onset: of the NHG in the late Pliocene, with much bigger phase lagged at the 41-kyr and 23-kyr bands than in the Pleistocene, which suggests that at the obliquity and precession bands the phases of the Plio-Pleistocene East Asian monsoon variations relative to the global ice volume changes are not constant, but variable. Therefore, the East Asian monsoons are not only simply driven by northern summer insolation at the precession period but also modulated by global ice volume change in high latitudes.

This investigation takes into account evidence from the Earth's history, from climate models and our understanding of the physical processes governing climate shifts. Sudden alterations to climate forcing seem to be improbable, with sudden changes instead most likely to arise from climate feedbacks. Based on projections from models validated against historical events, dramatic changes in ocean circulation appear unlikely. Ecosystem climate feedbacks clearly have the potential to induce sudden change, but are relatively poorly understood at present. More probable sudden changes are large increases in the frequency of summer heatwaves and changes resulting from feedbacks involving hydrology. These include ice sheet decay, which may be set in motion this century. The most devastating consequences are likely to occur further in the future, however. Reductions in subtropical precipitation are likely to be the most severe hydrologic effects this century, with rapid changes due to the feedbacks of relatively well-understood large-scale circulation patterns. Water stress may become particularly acute in the Southwest US and Mexico, and in the Mediterranean and Middle East, where rainfall decreases of 10 25\% (regionally) and up to 40\% (locally) are projected.","Columbia Univ, NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; LONDON; 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

Here, we analyse measured data sets and artificial time series of the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and of delta C-13 of CO2 over industrial and glacial/interglacial time scales and investigate to what extent the Keeling plot methodology can be applied to longer time scales. The artificial time series are simulation results of the global carbon cycle box model BICYCLE. The signals recorded in ice cores caused by abrupt terrestrial carbon uptake or release loose information due to air mixing in the firn before bubble enclosure and limited sampling frequency. Carbon uptake by the ocean cannot longer be neglected for less abrupt changes as occurring during glacial cycles. We introduce an equation for the calculation of long-term changes in the isotopic signature of atmospheric CO2 caused by an injection of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere, in which the ocean is introduced as third reservoir. This is a paleo extension of the two reservoir mass balance equations of the Keeling plot approach. It gives an explanation for the bias between the isotopic signature of the terrestrial release and the signature deduced with the Keeling plot approach for long-term processes, in which the oceanic reservoir cannot be neglected. These deduced isotopic signatures are similar (-8.6 parts per thousand) for steady state analyses of long-term changes in the terrestrial and marine biosphere which both perturb the atmospheric carbon reservoir. They are more positive than the delta C-13 signals of the sources, e.g. the terrestrial carbon pools themselves (similar to -25 parts per thousand). A distinction of specific processes acting on the global carbon cycle from the Keeling plot approach is not straightforward. In general, processes related to biogenic fixation or release of carbon have lower y-intercepts in the Keeling plot than changes in physical processes, however in many case they are indistinguishable (e.g. ocean circulation from biogenic carbon fixation).","Alfred Wegener Inst Polar \& Marine Res, Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, D-27515 Bremerhaven, Germany; Univ Liege, Inst Astrophys \& Geophys, Lab Phys Atmospher \& Planetaire, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; KATLENBURG-LINDAU; MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, 37191 KATLENBURG-LI","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

In the youngest part (1230-1600 m), they reveal variations of up to 25 ppmv around the mean atmospheric concentration within centimetres, corresponding to a snow deposition interval of a few years. Similar results are found at corresponding depth regions of the Dome C and the Tabs Dome ice cores. Since we can exclude all hitherto known processes altering the concentration of CO2 in ice cores, we present a hypothesis about spatial fractionation of air components related to episodically increasing clathrate formation followed by diffusion processes from bubbles to clathrates. This hypothesis is supported by optical line-scan observations and by O-2/N-2 measurements at the same depth where strong CO2 variations are detected. Below the clathrate formation zone, this small-scale fractionation process is slowly smoothed out, most likely by diffusion, regaining the initial mean atmospheric concentration. Although this process compromises the representativeness of a single CO2 measurement on small ice samples in the clathrate formation zone of an ice core, it does not affect the mean atmospheric CO2 concentration if CO2 values are averaged over a sufficiently long epth scale (>10 cm in case of the EPICA DML ice core).

Climate change has, and will continue to have, profound effects on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. As such, there is a critical need to continue to develop a sound scientific basis for national and international policies regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reflects on the nature of current global change experiments, and provides recommendations for a unified multidisciplinary approach to future research in this dynamic field. These recommendations include: (1) better integration between experiments and models, and amongst experimental, monitoring, and space-for-time studies; (2) stable and increased support for long-term studies and multi-factor experiments; (3) explicit inclusion of biodiversity, disturbance, and extreme events in experiments and models; (4) consideration of timing vs intensity of global change factors in experiments and models; (5) evaluation of potential thresholds or ecosystem 'tipping points'; and (6) increased support for model-model and model-experiment comparisons. These recommendations, which reflect discussions within the TERACC international network of global change scientists, will facilitate the unraveling of the complex direct and indirect effects of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and their components.

Under this premise it becomes natural to examine the Earth's organisation using physiological-like variables. Here we identify some of these main variables for the ocean's circulatory system: pump rate, stroke volume, carbon and nutrient arterial-venous differences, inorganic nutrients and carbon supply, and metabolic rate. The stroke volume is proportional to the water transported into the thermocline and deep oceans, and the arterial-venous differences occur between recently-upwelled deep waters and very productive high-latitudes waters, with atmospheric CO2 being an indicator of the arterial-venous inorganic carbon difference. The metabolic rate is the internal-energy flux (here expressed as flux of inorganic carbon in the upper ocean) required by the system's machinery, i.e. community respiration. We propose that the pump rate is set externally by the annual cycle, at one beat per year per hemisphere, and that the autotrophic ocean adjusts its stroke volume and arterial-venous differences to modify the internal-energy demand, triggered by long-period astronomical insolation cycles (external-energy supply). With this perspective we may conceive that the Earth's interglacial-glacial cycle responds to an internal organisation analogous to that occurring in living beings during an exercise-recovery cycle. We use an idealised double-state metabolic model of the upper ocean (with the inorganic carbon/nutrients supply specified through the overturning rate and the steady-state inorganic carbon/nutrients concentrations) to obtain the temporal evolution of its inorganic carbon concentration, which mimics the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 pattern.","CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain; BARCELONA; PG MARITIM DE LA BARCELONETA, 37-49, 08003 BARCELONA, SPAIN","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

This gas age-ice age difference depends on the age of the ice at the bottom of the firn layer, where the bubbles are closed-off. Firn densification models are used to calculate how this age difference varied in the past, but have an uncertainty on the order of 1000 years for central Antarctic sites. Here we explore the possibility that delta N-15 of N-2 is a gas phase proxy of climate, which can be used to synchronize gas and ice records. We present the delta N-15 record from the EPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core covering the last three glacial terminations and five glacial-interglacial cycles between 300 and 800 ka. Previous studies have shown that gravitational settling enriches delta N-15 as a function of the diffusive column height in the firn. If densification models' prediction of deeper firn close-off under glacial conditions is correct, then we would expect heavier delta N-15 during glacial periods, and a negative correlation with temperature. Instead, EDC delta N-15 is positively correlated with the ice deuterium content, a proxy for temperature, as previously reported at Vostok, Dome Fuji, and EPICA Dronning Maud Land. We propose a mechanism that links accumulation rate, firn permeability, and convective mixing in the top meters of the firn to explain this correlation between delta N-15 and ice deuterium content. The tightest correlation is observed over glacial terminations, supporting the idea that delta N-15 is a property in the gas phase that records changes in surface conditions linked to deglacial warming.

We found that maximum sea-ice extent is closely tied to Antarctic temperature on multi-millennial timescales, but less so on shorter timescales. Biological dimethylsulphide emissions south of the polar front seem to have changed little with climate, suggesting that sulphur compounds were not active in climate regulation. We observe large glacial-interglacial contrasts in iron deposition, which we infer reflects strongly changing Patagonian conditions. During glacial terminations, changes in Patagonia apparently preceded sea-ice reduction, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for different phases of CO2 increase during glacial terminations.

Both wind stress and fluctuations of the seawater density contribute to MOC changes on subannual and seasonal time scales, whereas the interannual variability mainly reflects changes in the density field. Even on subannual and seasonal time scales, a significant fraction of the total MOC variability is due to changes of the density field in the upper 1000 m of the ocean. These changes reflect perturbations of the isopycnal structure that travel westward as Rossby waves. Because of a temporally changing phase difference between the eastern and western boundaries, the Rossby waves affect the MOC by modifying the basinwide east-west density gradient. Both the numerical model used in this study and calculations based on Rossby wave theory suggest that this effect can account for an MOC variability of several Sverdrups (Sv 106 m(3) s(-1)).

Here an attempt is made to underline instead the possible importance of changes in the standing volumes of intra-oceanic carbon reservoirs (i.e. different water-masses) in influencing the total marine carbon inventory. By way of illustration, a simple mechanism is proposed for enhancing the marine carbon inventory via an increase in the volume of relatively cold and carbon-enriched deep water, analogous to modern Lower Circumpolar DeepWater (LCDW), filling the ocean basins. A set of simple box-model experiments confirm the expectation that a deep sea dominated by an expanded LCDW-like watermass holds more CO2, without any pre-imposed changes in ocean overturning rate, biological export or ocean-atmosphere exchange. The magnitude of this ""standing volume effect"" ( which operates by boosting the solubility- and biological pumps) might be as large as the contributions that have previously been attributed to carbonate compensation, terrestrial biosphere reduction or ocean fertilisation for example. By providing a means of not only enhancing but also driving changes in the efficiency of the biological- and solubility pumps, this standing volume mechanism may help to reduce the amount of glacial-interglacial CO2 change that remains to be explained by other mechanisms that are difficult to assess in the geological archive, such as reduced mass transport or mixing rates in particular. This in turn could help narrow the search for forcing conditions capable of pushing the global carbon cycle between glacial and interglacial modes.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Earth Sci, Godwin Lab Palaeoclimate Res, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, England; KATHLENBURG-LINDAU; MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, KATHLENBURG-LINDAU, 37191, GERMANY","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728136; data\_collection\_article:Siegenthaler, Urs; Stocker, Thomas F; Monnin, Eric; L\""{u}thi, Dieter; Schwander, Jakob; Stauffer, Bernhard; Raynaud, Dominique; Barnola, Jean-Marc; Fischer, Hubertus; Masson-Delmotte, Valerie; Jouzel, Jean (2005): Stable carbon cycle - Climate relationship during the Late Pleistocene.

We developed a method to simultaneously measure nitrogen and argon isotopes in trapped air from the same sample of polar ice. This method reduces the time required for analysis, allowing large numbers of measurements. We applied this method to the entire Holocene sequence of the GISP2 ice core (82.37-1692.22 m) with a 10-20 year sampling interval (670 depths). delta Ar-40 and delta N-15 show elevated values in the oldest part of the dataset, consistent with a thicker firn layer and increased temperature gradient in the firn due to the legacy of the abrupt warming at the end of the Younger Dryas interval and the gradual warming during the Preboreal interval (11.5-10.0 ka). The Preboreal Oscillation and the 8.2k event are clearly recorded. The data show remarkable stability after the 8.2k event. Available data suggests that post-coring gas loss involves two distinct types of fractionation. First, smaller molecules with less than a certain threshold size leak through the ice lattice with little isotopic fractionation. Second, gas composition changes via gas loss through microcracks, which induces isotopic fractionation. These two gas loss processes can explain most trends in our data and in other ice core records.

We compile and review the most recent evidences of the Neogene architectural change in the sedimentary units of the Antarctic continental margins to provide a comprehensive interpretation of timing and circumstances of the last of these changes. We review and interpret the seismic stratigraphy and the borehole data (where available) from 6 key sectors of East and West Antarctica: the continental margins of the Antarctic Peninsula, Prydz Bay, Wilkes Land, Weddell Sea, Eastern and Western Ross Sea. In these margins we identify the following change in the geometry of the sedimentary deposits: margin-wide erosion and subsequent progradation on the continental shelf, stratal downlap on the continental slope; major mass wasting deposits on the continental rise. The change is apparently synchronous and dated about 3 Ma in the Antarctic Peninsula and Prydz Bay margins and broadly concomitant in the others sectors. This suggests a common driving force, which we suggest to be the late Pliocene climatic change that induced the transition of the Antarctic ice sheet regime from polythermal to present polar cold, dry-based conditions. We infer that in consequence of the late Pliocene global cooling, meltwater decreased in quantity and focussed within the main ice-troughs where large ice streams began to flow. The regional erosion was followed by focussing of the sedimentary transport at the base of the large ice streams and faster progradation of sedimentary wedges at the mouth of the ice-troughs. This induced large failures of the continental slope, while the continental rise was progressively deprived of terrigenous sediments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the fact that all terminations cover the transition from a glacial maximum into an interglacial, there are large differences between single terminations. For some terminations, Antarctic temperature increased only moderately, while for others, the amplitude of change at the termination was much larger. For the different terminations, the rate of change in temperature is more similar than the magnitude or duration of change. These temperature changes were accompanied by vast changes in dust and sea salt deposition all over Antarctica. Here we investigate the phasing between a South American dust proxy (non-sea-salt calcium flux, nssCa(2+)), a sea ice proxy (sea salt sodium flux, ssNa(+)) and a proxy for Antarctic temperature (deuterium, delta D). In particular, we look into whether a similar sequence of events applies to all terminations, despite their different characteristics. All proxies are derived from the EPICA Dome C ice core, resulting in a relative dating uncertainty between the proxies of less than 20 years. At the start of the terminations, the temperature (delta D) increase and dust (nssCa(2+) flux) decrease start synchronously. The sea ice proxy (ssNa(+) flux), however, only changes once the temperature has reached a particular threshold, approximately 5 degrees C below present day temperatures (corresponding to a delta D value of -420 parts per thousand). This reflects to a large extent the limited sensitivity of the sea ice proxy during very cold periods with large sea ice extent. At terminations where this threshold is not reached (TVI, TVIII), ssNa(+) flux shows no changes. Above this threshold, the sea ice proxy is closely coupled to the Antarctic temperature, and interglacial levels are reached at the same time for both ssNa(+) and delta D. On the other hand, once another threshold at approximately 2 degrees C below present day temperature is passed (corresponding to a delta D value of -402 parts per thousand), nssCa(2+) flux has reached interglacial levels and does not change any more, despite further warming. This threshold behaviour most likely results from a combination of changes to the threshold friction velocity for dust entrainment and to the distribution of surface wind speeds in the dust source region.","[Roethlisberger, R.; Mudelsee, M.; Sime, L.; Wolff, E.

The astronomical forcing is selected at two dates with opposite precession, one when northern hemisphere (NH) summer occurs at perihelion (at 506 ka (1 ka=1000 years) BP), and the other when it occurs at aphelion (at 495 ka BP). Five different volumes of the Eurasian ice sheet (EA) and North American ice sheet (NA), ranging from 0 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) one, are used. The global cooling due to the ice sheets is mainly related to their area, little to their height. The regional cooling and warming anomalies caused by the ice sheets intensify with increasing size. Precipitation over different monsoon regions responds differently to the size of the ice sheets. Over North Africa and India, precipitation decreases with increasing ice sheet size due to the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), whatever the astronomical configuration is. However, the situation is more complicated over East Asia. The ice sheets play a role through both reducing the land/ocean thermal contrast and generating a wave train which is topographically induced by the EA ice sheet. This wave train contributes to amplify the Asian land/ocean pressure gradient in summer and finally reinforces the precipitation. The presence of this wave train depends on the combined effect of the ice sheet size and insolation. When NH summer occurs at perihelion, the EA is able to induce this wave train whatever its size is, and this wave train plays a more important role than the reduction of the land/ocean thermal contrast. Therefore, the ice sheets reinforce the summer precipitation over East China whatever their sizes are. However, when NH summer occurs at aphelion, there is a threshold in the ice volume beyond which the wave train is not induced anymore. Therefore, below this threshold, the wave train effect is dominant and the ice sheets reinforce precipitation over East China. Beyond this threshold, the ice sheets reduce the precipitation mainly through reducing the land/ocean thermal contrast.","[Yin, Q.

Simulated data was used to demonstrate that the relationship between proxy values and the climatic data are adversely affected by falling correlation, to the point where, in a training set consisting of 100 pairs of temperature and tree-ring proxies, the mean 95\% confidence interval width for the reconstructed temperature exceeds the total range of temperatures in the training set at or below r = 0.65.

Two CO2 treatments were used during a mesocosm CO2 perturbation experiment in a Norwegian fjord (present day: similar to 380 ppmv and year 2100: similar to 750 ppmv), and phytoplankton blooms were stimulated by the addition of nutrients. Seawater trace gas concentrations were monitored over the growth and decline of the blooms, revealing that concentrations of methyl iodide and dimethylsulfide were significantly reduced under high CO2. Additionally, large reductions in concentrations of other iodo-carbons were observed. The response of bromocarbons to high CO2 was less clear cut.

At least during glacial periods, the Antarctic dust fluctuations appear to be largely controlled by environmental changes in southern South America. We compare dust flux records from two Antarctic ice-cores to variations in the composition of the terrigenous supply at ODP Site 1233 located off southern Chile and known to record fluctuations in the extent of the northern part of the Patagonian ice-sheet (NPIS) during the last glacial period (marine Isotope Stage, MIS, 4 to 2). Within age uncertainties, millennial-scale glacial advances (retreats) of the NPIS correlate to Antarctic dust maxima (minima). In turn, NPIS fluctuations were closely related to offshore sea surface temperature (SST) changes. This pattern suggests a causal link involving changes in temperature, in rock flour availability, in latitudinal extensions of the westerly winds and in foehn winds in the southern Pampas and Patagonia. We further suggest that the long-term trend of dust accumulation is partly linked to the sea-level related changes in the size if the Patagonian source area due to the particular morphology of the Argentine shelf. We suggest that sea-level drops at the beginning of MIS 4 and MIS 2 were important for long-term dust increases, while changes in the Patagonian dust source regions primarily control the early dust decrease during the MIS 4/3 transition and Termination 1.

In the traditional view, the sole effect of expanded sea ice coverage is to reduce the atmospheric pCO(2) by inhibiting air-sea gas exchange. However, this view neglects the effect that sea ice capping has on the biological production. By limiting light for photosynthesis, larger sea ice coverage would reduce the strength of the biological pump and therefore increase atmospheric pCO(2). Recently, Kurahashi-Nakamura et al. (2007) suggested that the opposing impact of biology on atmospheric pCO(2) will more than offset the gas exchange effect, such that atmospheric pCO(2) will actually increase with larger sea ice coverage. In an effort to resolve this controversy, we use an intermediate-complexity, global model of biogeochemistry and climate to determine the sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 concentration to changes in the sea ice coverage, driven by prescribed changes in sea ice albedo. When sea ice in our model is increased by 34\% globally relative to the control run, gas solubility, ice capping effect and stratification increase, while biological production decreases; overall atmospheric pCO(2) is reduced by 9.4 ppmv. Our results broadly support the notion that the biological response of sea ice capping is as important as its physical response. Furthermore, we show that the overall change in atmospheric pCO(2) is indeed inversely related to sea ice coverage, but it is not because sea ice caps off gas exchange but because gas solubility is increased by lower temperatures that accompany sea ice expansion in our model simulations.","[Sun, Xiaoting; Matsumoto, Katsumi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geol \& Geophys, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.728237; data\_collection\_article:Gersonde, Rainer; Crosta, Xavier; Abelmann, Andrea; Armand, Leanne K (2005): Sea-surface temperature and sea ice distribution of the Southern Ocean at the EPILOG Last Glacial Maximum: A circum-Antarctic view based on siliceous microfossil records.

Superimposed on this in northwest Europe is localised evidence for human impact on the landscape, although separating climatic and anthropogenic mechanisms for environmental change is often difficult. Biotic and sedimentological evidence from a lacustrine sequence from the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, shows a considerable reduction in inferred local woodland centred upon 8250 cal. yr BP. These data correlate precisely with a distinctive rise in the charcoal:pollen ratio and hence suggest a possible Mesolithic human impact upon the vegetation around this time. A quantitative temperature reconstruction from chironomid analyses from the same sequence, supported by sedimentological data, indicates that the fall in arboreal pollen taxa occurred as climate warmed significantly during the early Holocene. This warming was followed by a significant cold event, with mean July temperatures reduced by 2 degrees C, that lasted for at least 320 years ca. 7790-7470 cal. yr BP. Woodland recovered during this phase suggesting that the vegetation during the 8250 cal.yrBP interval was likely to have been responding to human activity, and not climate, and hence it is possible at specific sites to separate the influence of these key drivers of environmental change.

Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations vary from 2 to over 20 wt\% in the sequences of ""black shales"" that were deposited over a period of similar to 20 million years. Similarly long periods of elevated marine productivity implied by the high TOC concentrations are uncommon in the geological record and must have required unusual paleoceanographic conditions.The importance of nitrogen fixing bacteria to sustaining the amplified export production of organic matter is indicated by delta N-15 values that remain between -4\%, and 0 parts per thousand a range that is notably less positive than the average of +5 parts per thousand for modern ocean sediments. Although containing mostly marine organic matter, the black shales have TOC/TN molar ratios between 20 and 40 that mimic those of land plant organic matter. The anomalously large TOC/TN ratios suggest selective organic matter degradation, probably associated with low oxygen conditions in the water column, that favored preservation of nitrogen poor forms of organic matter relative to nitrogen rich components. Deposition of black shales on the Demerara Rise was likely a consequence of the mid-Cretaceous warm and wet greenhouse climate that strengthened thermohaline stratification of this part of the Atlantic Ocean, which in turn encouraged bacterial nitrogen fixation, enhanced primary production, magnified organic matter export, and ultimately established anoxic conditions at the seafloor that improved preservation of organic matter for much of the 20 My period represented by these thick sequences.

Organic carbon concentrations that often exceed 5\% in both types of sequences record episodes of exceptional accumulation of organic matter. Although both are rich in marine organic matter, they have high C/N ratios that mimic those of land-plant organic matter, which suggests less-efficient organic matter recycling than in the modem ocean. The coupled presence of isorenieratene derivatives and low delta N-15 values that result from microbial primary productivity indicates that photic zone anoxia existed during their formation and implies strong stratification of the surface ocean. Enrichments of redox-sensitive metals and sediment laminations indicate that anoxia existed deeper in the water column and at the seafloor. Multiple proxies indicate freshening of surface waters of the Mediterranean and imply periods of wetter climate during times of sapropel deposition. Episodes of black shale deposition similarly coincide with times of wetter climate. These comparisons suggest that the wetter climate created similar conditions of surface salinity stratification that enhanced microbial primary production and magnified organic matter export during deposition of both the Mediterranean sapropels and mid-Cretaceous black shales.

Benthic foraminiferal faunas in the lower part of the studied succession show high abundances of Praebulimina reussi and Nuttallides truempyi and are proposed to reflect fluctuations in organic matter flux to the seafloor (meso- to eutrophic) under oxygenated bottom-water conditions. The middle interval is characterized by very low numbers of benthic foraminiferal specimens but a dominance of thick-walled species (e.g., lenticulinids, laevidentalinids), may reflect carbonate dissolution. In contrast to the lower part, benthic foraminifera from the upper part of the succession show well-oxygenated bottom waters. The most dominant species during this interval are Gavelinella beccardformis, Reussella szajnochae, and N. truempyi. Parallel to this change in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages the number of inoceramid shells decreases, reflecting a significant increase in bottom-water oxygenation. Based on these data we speculate, that the observed changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages towards a well-oxygenated environment within the Early Maastrichtian of DSDP Site 390 could reflect the onset of a shift from low-latitude to high-latitude deep-water sources. This speculation will predate the major reorganization of the oceanic circulation resulting in a circulation mode similar to today at the Early/Late Maastrichtian boundary by similar to 1 Ma.

Variations in M1-5 oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) are interpreted to be primarily driven by an amount effect related to changes in the mean position and/or intensity of convection of the intertropical convergence zone, the island's only source of precipitation. The M 1-5 delta O-18 time series is strongly correlated to the Greenland ice cores, similar to an older Socotra speleothem deposited from 53-40 ka [S.J. Bums, D. Fleitmann, A. Matter, J. Kramers, A. Al-Subbary, Indian Ocean climate and an absolute chronology over Dansgaard/Oeschger events 9 to 13, Science 301 (2003) 1365-1367], indicating that a North Atlantic-Indian Ocean cold-dry/warm-wet teleconnection persisted through the end of the last glacial period. Peak aridification occurred at similar to 23 ka and a gradual increase in moisture thereafter was interrupted by an abrupt drying event at similar to 16.4 ka, perhaps related to Heinrich event 1. Indian Ocean rainfall increased dramatically during the Bolling period and then decreased continuously and gradually through the Allerod and Younger Dryas. The Holocene began abruptly with increased precipitation at 11.4 ka and was followed by a major but short-lived drying during the Preboreal Oscillation at similar to 11.2 ka. M1-5 is highly correlated to the Dongge Cave record from 15.5-11 ka, suggesting much of the Indian Ocean monsoon region responded similarly to the major climate changes of the last deglaciation. The transitions into the Younger Dryas and to a lesser extent the Bolling are remarkably gradual in M1-5, as they are in all other Asian speleothem records, occurring over several centuries. These gradual transitions are in striking contrast to high-resolution records from around the North Atlantic basin where the transitions are extremely abrupt and generally occur in under a century. This spatially variable pattern of climate change is consistent with an Atlantic origin for these deglacial climate events. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

By combining these new results with recently published records from the region, we reconstruct the spatial pattern of changes in SST during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Alkenone-based SST estimates show a greater glacial cooling in the upwelling environment of the cold tongue than in sites located further north in the equatorial front and eastern Pacific Warm Pool. This result agrees with the paradigm of stronger glacial winds, increased upwelling, steeper zonal thermocline tilt, and stronger advection of cold water in the Peru Current. Furthermore, we investigate possible changes in glacial surface hydrography by using the alkenone-based SST reconstructions to correct planktonic foraminifera delta O-18 for the temperature effect. After additional correction for the global ice volume effect, the residual changes in seawater delta O-18 show a clear latitudinal pattern that would be consistent with a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We thus suggest that changes in sea surface salinities could explain contrasting SST reconstructions based on planktonic foraminifera delta O-18, which implied a weakening of the cold tongue. The controversial LGM dynamics of the EEP reconstructed by different proxies, i.e., a weakening or a strengthening of the cold tongue, highlight the necessity to better assess the influence of various biases on these proxies.","[Dubois, Nathalie; Kienast, Markus; Normandeau, Claire] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada; [Herbert, Timothy D.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.737972; data\_collection\_article:Kaiser, J\'{e}rome; Lamy, Frank; Hebbeln, Dierk (2005): A 70-kyr sea surface temperature record off southern Chile (Ocean Drilling Programm Site 1233).

The low thermal maturity of Indiana coals with vitrinite reflectance R-0 similar to 0.6\% is in agreement with an overwhelmingly biogenic isotopic signature of coalbed gases containing >= 96\% methane generated via bacterial CO2-reduction. In contrast, thermogenic gas was generated in the stratigraphically equivalent coal beds in western Kentucky's Rough Creek Graben zone where higher maturities of up to R-0 similar to 0.8\% were reached owing to tectonic and hydrothermal activity. No secondary biogenic methane was observed in more mature western Kentucky coal beds where greater burial depth limits the recharge of meteoric water.

Multibeam bathymetry mapping of the Middle America Trench reveals numerous continental slope failures of different dimensions and origin. For example, large rotational slumps have been interpreted to be caused by slope collapse in the wake of subducting sea-mounts. In contrast, the mechanisms generating translational slides have not yet been described. Lithology, shear strength measurements, density, and pore water alkalinity from a sediment core across a slide plane indicate that a few centimeters thick intercalated volcanic tephra layer marks the detachment surface. The ash layer can be correlated to the San Antonio tephra, emplaced by the 6000 year old caldera-forming eruption from Masaya-Caldera, Nicaragua. The distal deposits of this eruption are widespread along the continental slope and ocean plate offshore Nicaragua. Grain size measurements permit us to estimate the reconstruction of the original ash layer thickness at the investigated slide. Direct shear test experiments on Middle American ashes show a high volume reduction during shearing. This indicates that marine tephra layers have the highest hydraulic conductivity of the different types of slope sediment, enabling significant volume reduction to take place under undrained conditions. This makes ash layers mechanically distinct within slope sediment sequences. Here we propose a mechanism by which ash layers may become weak planes that promote translational sliding. The mechanism implies that ground shaking by large earthquakes induces rearrangement of ash shards causing their compaction (volume reduction) and produces a rapid accumulation of water in the upper part of the layer that is capped by impermeable clay. The water-rich veneer abruptly reduces shear strength, creating a detachment plane for translational sliding. Tephra layers might act as slide detachment planes at convergent margins of subducting zones, at submarine slopes of volcanic islands, and at submerged volcano slopes in lakes.","[Harders, Rieka; Kutterolf, Steffen; Hensen, Christian] Univ Kiel, IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Meereswissensch, SFB 574, D-24148 Kiel, Germany; [Moerz, Tobias] MARUM, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.737976; data\_collection\_article:Riedinger, Natascha; Pfeifer, Kerstin; Kasten, Sabine; Garming, J F Linda; Vogt, Christoph; Hensen, Christian (2005): Diagenetic alteration of magnetic signals by anaerobic oxidation of methane related to a change in sedimentation rate.

The usefulness of the surviving paleomagnetic record in such environments is Usually argued to depend on how much of the primary detrital magnetic assemblage survives diagenetic dissolution. Detailed rock magnetic and electron microscope analyses of rapidly deposited (similar to 7 cm/kyr) latest Pleistocene-Holocene sediments from the continental margins of Oman (22 degrees 22.4'N, 60 degrees 08.0'E) and northern California (38 degrees 24.8'N, 123 degrees 58.2'W) demonstrate that pyritization during early diagenesis also leads to the progressive down-core growth of the ferrimagnetic iron Sulfide greigite. Greigite growth begins with nucleation of large concentrations Of superparamagnetic (SP) nanoparticles at the inferred position of the sulfate-methane transition, which can explain the apparently paradoxical suggestion that diagenetically reduced sediments contain enhanced concentrations of SP particles. Looping of hysteresis parameters on a ""Day"" plot records the dissolution of single domain (SD) (titano-)magnetite and the formation of SP greigite, which then slowly and progressively grows through its SD blocking volume and acquires a stable paleomagnetic signal. This looping trend is also evident in data from several published records (Oregon margin, Korea Strait, Japan Sea, Niger Fan, Argentine margin, and the Ontong-Java Plateau), indicating that these processes may be widespread in reducing environments. Our observations have profound implications for paleomagnetic records from sulfate-reducing environments. The paleomagnetic signal recorded by greigite is offset from the age of the surrounding sediments by 10's of kyr, and ongoing growth of greigite at depth results in smoothing of the recorded signal over intervals of 10's to 100's of kyr. We therefore expect the presence of greigite to compromise paleomagnetic records in a wide range of settings that have undergone reductive diagenesis.

Good coherence between the paleoproductivity records and the DOT suggests that the DOT changes could be the primary control factor in changes of paleoproductivity, and the glacial high productivity in the Kuroshio source region could be associated with a global increase of nutrient concentration in the intermediate waters that upwelled into the photic zone. The low CO2 values derived for intervals of high productivity and a relatively shallow DOT suggest that the changes in biological productivity and DOT in the equatorial Pacific could have modified atmospheric CO2 concentrations. High Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) during the warm MIS 5e in combination with intensified monsoonal rain fall could have resulted in a more intense stratification of the upper waters, resulting in low nutrient supply to the surface waters and a resulting decrease in productivity.

We infer the magnitude of this lag on the basis of the phase relationship between equatorial sea surface temperature and benthic delta O-18. We infer that Pliocene delta O-18 minima should lag obliquity maxima by 19 degrees (2.2 ka), broadly consistent with the current global marine delta O-18 chronology, and precession maxima by 32 degrees (2 ka), a difference of 160 degrees (10.2 ka) relative to the current global marine delta O-18 chronology. Only in the context of this revision are Pliocene summer and winter monsoon phase relationships consistent with direct orbital forcing across the entire Indo-Asian region, including marine and terrestrial proxies from the Chinese Loess Plateau, the South China Sea, and the Arabian Sea. Strong Pliocene summer and winter monsoons were in phase with one another, strengthened at obliquity minima and precession minima; the summer monsoon was also strengthened at precession maxima, yielding a semiprecession spectral signal. Strong Pliocene monsoons at orbital extremes indicate a direct response to fast physics processes including sensible heating and cooling of the Asian landmass and, for the summer monsoon, the export of latent heat from the southern Indian Ocean. As Northern Hemisphere ice volume grew into the Pleistocene, the timing of strong winter and summer monsoons drifted apart becoming influenced by the combined effects of fast physics and slow physics (ice volume) variables. The phase of strong winter monsoons shifted toward ice maxima, and the phase of strong summer monsoons shifted toward ice minima.","[Clemens, Steven C.; Prell, Warren L.] Brown Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Sun, Youbin; Chen, Guangshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, Xian 710075, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengyu; Chen, Guangshan] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res,","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738202; data\_collection\_article:Schmiedl, Gerhard; Leuschner, Dirk C (2005): Oxygenation changes in the deep western Arabian Sea during the last 190,000 years: productivity versus deep-water circulation.

An Atlantic-Pacific cladogenic event (95\% HPD 3.2-9.6) took place after the closure of the Tethyan Sea, suggesting that dispersal occurred from the Indo-Pacific, most likely via southern Africa.

The timing of the Azolla phase (similar to 48.5 Ma) coincides with the earliest signs of onset of the transition from a greenhouse towards the modern icehouse Earth. The sustained growth of Azolla, currently ranking among the fastest growing plants on Earth, in a major anoxic oceanic basin may have contributed to decreasing atmospheric pCO(2) levels via burial of Azolla-derived organic matter. The consequences of these enormous Azolla blooms for regional and global nutrient and carbon cycles are still largely unknown. Cultivation experiments have been set up to investigate the influence of elevated pCO(2) on Azolla growth, showing a marked increase in Azolla productivity under elevated (760 and 1910 ppm) pCO(2) conditions. The combined results of organic carbon, sulphur, nitrogen content and N-15 and C-13 measurements of sediments from the Azolla interval illustrate the potential contribution of nitrogen fixation in a euxinic stratified Eocene Arctic. Flux calculations were used to quantitatively reconstruct the potential storage of carbon (0.9-3.5 10(18) gC) in the Arctic during the Azolla interval. It is estimated that storing 0.9 10(18) to 3.5 10(18) g carbon would result in a 55 to 470 ppm drawdown of pCO(2) under Eocene conditions, indicating that the Arctic Azolla blooms may have had a significant effect on global atmospheric pCO(2) levels through enhanced burial of organic matter.","[Speelman, E.

Around 2500/2400 cal yr BP, a significant decrease of mature forest and swamp forest taxa and an increase of pioneers indicate that the rain forest was seriously disturbed and replaced by secondary formations. The dominance of Trema orientalis, a pioneer well adapted to seasonal desiccation, points to a much more accentuated seasonality after 2500 cal yr BP, which seems to be linked to a Southwards shift of the ITCZ during the northern hemisphere winter months.

The investigation site, Samoylov Island, is situated in the zone of continuous permafrost and is characterized by wet polygonal tundra. The summer energy and water balance of the tundra was analyzed for the dry year 1999 and the wet year 2003. The summer water balance of the tundra was found to be mainly controlled by precipitation. The partitioning of the available energy was controlled by precipitation via the soil moisture regime, and by the synoptic weather conditions via radiation and the advection of maritime cold or continental warm air masses. In 2003, regular high precipitation resulted in a constant recharge of polygonal ponds. Of the available energy, 61\% were partitioned into latent heat flux and 17\% into ground heat flux; hence, the tundra behaved like a typical wetland. In 1999, low precipitation resulted in a loss of polygonal pond waters and a drying of upper soil layers. This led to lower latent heat flux (31\% of available energy), higher ground heat flux (29\%), and a considerably higher soil thaw depth compared to 2003. Surface and subsurface water flow had a significant influence on the tundra water balance. In 2003, the formation of new surface flow channels through thermo-erosion was observed, which is expected to have a strong and lasting influence on the hydrologic system of the tundra.","[Boike, Julia; Wille, Christian] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar \& Marine Res, Periglacial Sect, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Abnizova, Anna] York Univ, Dept Geog, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738265; data\_collection\_article:Spielhagen, Robert F; Siegert, Christine; Erlenkeuser, Helmut (2005): History of freshwater runoff across the Laptev Sea (Arctic) during the last degaciation.

Habitat mapping confirmed that distinctive mounded bathymetry was formed by reefs of Lophelia pertusa with surficial coral debris dating to almost 4000 yr. Benthic lander and mooring deployments revealed 2 dominant food supply mechanisms to the reefs: a regular rapid downwelling of surface water delivering pulses of warm fluorescent water, and periodic advection of high turbidity bottom waters. Closed chamber respirometry studies suggest that L. pertusa responds to seawater warming, such as that seen during the rapid downwelling events, with increases in metabolic rate. Lipid biomarker analysis implies that corals at Mingulay feed predominantly on herbivorous calanoid copepods. Integrating geophysical and hydrographical survey data allowed us to quantify the roles of these environmental factors in controlling biodiversity of attached epifaunal species across the reefs. Longitudinal structuring of these communities is striking: species richness (alpha) and turnover (beta) change significantly west to east, with variation in community composition largely explained by bathymetric variables that are spatially structured on the reef complex. Vibro-cores through the reef mounds show abundant coral debris with significant hiatuses. High resolution side-scan sonar revealed trawl marks in areas south of the coral reefs where vessel monitoring system data showed the highest density of local fishing activity. The interdisciplinary approach in this study allowed us to record the food supply and hydrographic environment experienced by L. pertusa and determine how it may be ecophysiologically adapted to these conditions. Improved basic understanding of cold-water coral biology and biodiversity alongside efforts to map and date these long-lived habitats are vital to development of future conservation policies.","[Roberts, J.

In 2005, a study was made of the trophic structure of a Rockall coral mound community by means of N-15 stable isotope signatures. Simultaneously near-bottom current speed, turbidity, and temperature were measured on and off the mound to search for links between the predominant feeding mode of the coral community, the particle supply, and the physical factors governing the supply. The range of delta N-15 in the coral community was small in comparison to other deep habitats due to the absence of deposit-feeders. The delta N-15 of corals was very close to those of obligate filter-feeders (tunicate, bivalves) indicating that corals assimilate similar types of particles as these filter-feeders. Benthic lander deployments on the mound and in the adjacent gully and plains showed that currents were highest off mound. No major differences were found in near-bottom turbidity between the habitats at the time of the cruise. An 11-mo lander deployment revealed an extended supply of fluorescent particles to the mound community between early February and July 2005. Particle supply to the corals varied daily with higher concentrations associated with relatively warm and saline water flowing down slope. The collected data point to a simplified food web in the coral community sustained by an advection of fresh particles derived from production higher on the bank. The typical distribution of cold-water corals capping the mounds cannot be explained simply by enhanced currents relative to the adjacent plain and gully.","[Duineveld, Gerard C.

Here we present new biomarker data determined in ACEX sediment samples to decipher processes controlling OC accumulation and their paleoenvironmental significance during periods of Paleogene global warmth and proposed increased freshwater discharge in the early Cenozoic. Specific source-related biomarkers including n-alkanes, fatty acids, isoprenoids, carotenoids, hopanes/hopenes, hopanoic acids, aromatic terpenoids, and long-chain alkenones show a high variability of components, derived from marine and terrestrial origin. The distribution of hopanoic acid isomers is dominated by compounds with the biological 17 beta(H), 21 beta(H) configuration indicating a low level of maturity. On the basis of the biomarker data the terrestrial OC supply was significantly enriched during the late Paleocene and part of the earliest Eocene, whereas increased aquatic contributions and euxinic conditions of variable intensity were determined for the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum and Eocene thermal maximum 2 events as well as the middle Eocene time interval. Furthermore, samples from the middle Eocene are characterized by the occurrence of long-chain alkenones, high proportions of lycopane, and high ratios (> 0.6) of (n-C-35 + lycopane)/n-C-31. The occurrence of C-37-alkenenones, which were first determined toward the end of the Azolla freshwater event, indicates that the OC becomes more marine in origin during the middle Eocene. Preliminary U(37)(K'-)based sea surface temperature (SST) values display a longterm temperature decrease of about 15 degrees C during the time interval 49-44.5 Ma (25 degrees to 10 degrees C), coinciding with the global benthic delta O-18 cooling trend after the early Eocene climatic optimum. At about 46 Ma, parallel with onset of ice-rafted debris, SST (interpreted as summer temperatures) decreased to values < 15 degrees C. For the late early Miocene a SST of 11 degrees-15 degrees C was determined. Most of the middle Eocene ACEX sediments are characterized by a smooth short-chain n-alkane distribution, which may point to natural oil-type hydrocarbons from leakage of petroleum reservoirs or erosion of related source rocks and redeposition.","[Weller, Petra; Stein, Ruediger] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar \& Marine Res, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; WASHINGTON; 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738377; data\_collection\_article:McClymont, Erin L; Rosell-Mel\'{e}, V; Giraudeau, Jaques; Pierre, Catherine; Lloyd, Jerry M (2005): Alkenone and coccolith records of the mid-Pleistocene in the south-east Atlantic: implications for the Uk37' index and South African climate.

However, recent studies have shown poor correlation between these two proxies in continental-margin sediments. We reevaluated the relationship and expanded it to include a suite of biogeochemical transformation products of the parent dinosterol (dinosterone, dinostanone, and dinostanol). These dinoflagellate-specific 4 alpha,23,24-trimethyl steroidal species (Sigma(dinosterol)) are compared to dinocyst counts in sediments from the western Mexican margin (375-3,500 m). Samples were taken from subsurface (3-6 cm) and down core (16-27 cm) to reflect widely contrasting organic carbon content and redox conditions. A strong correlation was found between the sum of all dinoflagellate-derived sterols, Sigma(dinosterols), and total dinocyst counts, highlighting the importance of including diagenetic alteration products of the parent molecule when exploiting organic biomarkers in paleoceanographic studies. In low-energy environments and for well-preserved samples, such as those studied in this work, both methods provide robust, internally consistent data, suggesting that when diagenetic transformation products of dinosterol are taken into account, gas chromatography and optical microscopy could be used interchangeably to estimate dinoflagellate inputs to marine sediments.","Concordia Univ, Dept Chem \& Biochem, Geotop, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Terre, Geotop, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; WACO; 5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738562; data\_collection\_article:de Vernal, Anne; Eynaud, Fr\'{e}d\'{e}rique; Henry, Maryse; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude; Londeix, Laurent; Mangin, Sylvie; Matthiessen, Jens; Marret, Fabienne; Radi, Taoufik; Rochon, Andr\'{e}; Solignac, Sandrine; Turon, Jean-Louis (2005): Reconstruction of sea-surface conditions at middle to highlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the Last Glacial Maximum(LGM) based on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages.

However, these results warrant confirmation from additional locations and water depths because the interpretation of the sedimentary Pa-231/Th-230 ratio in terms of circulation vigor can be biased by variations in particle flux and composition. We have measured Pa-231/Th-230 in a core from the Iberian margin, in the Northeastern Atlantic basin, and have compared these new results to the data from the western Atlantic basin. We find that the reduction in the circulation during H1 and YD and the subsequent increases first recognized in the sediment deposited on Ben-nuda Rise are also evident in the eastern basin, in a totally different sedimentary regime, confirming that sedimentary Pa-231/Th-230 ratios record basin-wide changes in deep water circulation. However, some differences between the eastern and western records are also recognized, providing preliminary evidence to differentiate between renewal rates in the two North Atlantic basins and between shallower and deeper overturning. Our results suggest the possible existence of two sources of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Deep Water (GNAIW), one in the south Labrador Sea and another west of Rockall Plateau. Both sources contributed to the meridional overturning but the two had different sensitivity to meltwater from the Laurentide and the Fermoscandian ice sheets during the deglaciation. These results indicate that additional information on the geometry and strength of the ventilation of the deep Atlantic can be obtained by contrasting the evolution of sediment Pa-231/Th-230 in different sections of the Atlantic Ocean.

For accuracy it is essential to know how environmental parameters such as salinity, temperature and light influence dinoflagellate cyst production and morphology. Here the effect of variation in these parameters on production and morphology of Tuberculodinium vancampoae (the resting stage of Pyrophacus steinii) is detailed. Encystment of T vancampoae has been observed in all studied culture-experiments although only a few cysts are being formed at the limits of the temperature and salinity ranges (16.5 degrees C, 34.8 degrees C and 20, 45 psu) with highest cyst production at 27 degrees C and 35 psu. Temperature clearly affects cyst morphology; cysts formed in cultures grown at 16.5 degrees C and 34.8 degrees C possess small, flattened processes. These cysts are not completely absent in cultures grown at intermediate temperatures but form only a minor part of the association. In previous studies, salinity has been found to influence the cyst morphology of several dinoflagellate species but this seems not to be the case for T vancampoae. In this study there was no morphological variation related to salinity. High cyst production was observed in cultures grown under moderate to strong illumination but variation in illumination did not lead to morphological change. Our findings correspond to field observations where T. vancampoae has been observed in surface sediments of the sub-tropical to tropical regions characterised by mean sea surface temperatures between 12.7 degrees C and 29.5 degrees C, and sea surface salinities between 16.9 and 36.6 psu. In contrast to previous suggestions, T vancampoae appears to be heterothallic rather than homothallic. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The Bardin Bluffs Formation of the Pagodroma Group is one of the key deposits on the Antarctic continent recording glaciomarine sedimentation under open marine fjord conditions as recently as the Plio-Pleistocene. In modern fjords occupied by outlet glaciers of ice sheets, the composition of fine-grained terrigenous sediments approaches that of unweathered rock types exposed upstream. In the Bardin Bluffs Formation, average abundances of stable elements (Ti, Al, Zr) approach average upper crustal compositions and the element ratios are consistent with sediments with a cratonic source, implying glacial dispersal from a large shield area through the Lambert Glacier drainage system. Interestingly, the chemical index of alteration (CIA) of these sediments has values similar to those of average shales formed under conditions of chemical weathering. The sediments are particularly depleted in silicate Ca, which has been observed elsewhere in glacial muds sourced from pre-glacial saprolites. The anomalous chemistry of the Bardin Bluffs Formation can be explained by a sequence of events, involving chemical weathering prior to glacial expansion and erosion. The presence of a remnant 1.5 m deep late Neogene weathering profile at the base of the Bardin Bluffs sequence corroborates this conclusion. Supply of large quantities of chemically weathered materials to Antarctic marginal basins requires at least partial deglaciation of the continent and was previously regarded as uncharacteristic for late Neogene Antarctica.","Montclair State Univ, Dept Earth \& Environm Studies, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; Univ Tasmania, Inst Antarctic \& So Ocean Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.742608; data\_collection\_article:Junttila, Juho; Ruikka, Marttiina; Strand, Kari O (2005): Clay-mineral assemblages in high-resolution Plio-Pleistocene interval at ODP Site 1165, Prydz Bay, Antarctica.

A global review of similar to 400 Quaternary glacial denudation rates estimated from five different measurement techniques provides values ranging between 10(-4) and 10 mm yr(-1). We investigate the causes of such wide variability by examining the respective influences of environmental setting and methodological bias. A reference frame chosen for assessing these issues is the Massif du Carlit (Pyrenees, France), where a quantified mass balance of the well preserved glacial, periglacial and paraglacial deposits was made possible by detailed geomorphological mapping and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating of extant erosional and depositional landform sequences. Resulting age brackets helped to define three main episodes of ice-cap growth and decline, each characterized by a volume of debris and a mappable source area. Erosion rates were expressed in two ways: (i) as spatially averaged denudation rates (D) during the successive stages of glacial advance to the line of maximum ice extent (MIE), post-MIE ice recession, and Lateglacial cirque readvance, respectively: and (ii) as cirque-wall recession rates (R) where moraine facies criteria indicated a supra-glacial provenance of debris. Results indicate low erosion (D approximate to 0.05 mm yr(-1)) during the ice advance phase, probably because of thin or passive ice covering the low-gradient subglacial topography that occurs just above the late Pleistocene equilibrium line altitude (2.2-2.4 km). Erosion rates peaked (D approximate to 0.6 mm yr(-1) and R approximate to 2.4-4.5 mm yr(-1)) during the main transition to ice-free conditions, when deglacial debuttressing promoted the rapid response of freshly exposed slope systems to new equilibrium conditions in the steep crest zone. Lateglacial D- and R-values declined to 0.2-0.3 mm yr(-1), with indications of spatially variable R controlled by lithology. In this environment glaciers overall behaved more as conveyors of debris supplied by supraglacial rock exposures in the mountain crest zone than as powerful modifiers of subglacial topography. This explains the widespread preservation of deep, in situ preglacial weathering profiles on relict Cenozoic land surfaces in the deglacierized part of the Eastern Pyrenees. When plotted on the global data set analyzed and discussed in the review, the East Pyrenean erosion rates stand out as being amongst the lowest on record. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the combined palaeoenvironmental and archaeological study of highland human management at a micro-regional scale remains a largely unexplored research field, especially in the Pyrenees. A combined pollen, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and macrocharcoal study was carried out at three nearby alpine and subalpine peat basins from a relatively small territory (ca.1700 ha) at the Madriu valley (Andorra, eastern Pyrenees), following a fine spatial-resolution strategy. The purpose was to test the suitability of high altitudinal palaeoecological sequences when reconstructing past small-scale land-use variability. The palaeoecological results of those peat records are compared and further integrated with archaeological local data, and together underline the marked complexity of high mountain land-use system over the Holocene period. Main phases of micro-regional land-use and landscape variability can be distinguished from the middle Neolithic to the early Bronze Age and from the Roman Period to the Modern Era. Conversely, several phases of homogeneous landscape management are distinguishable during the early Neolithic, and from the late Bronze to the late Iron Age. Results drawn from this study show that landscape variability is not necessarily connected to topographic or climatic parameters, and underline the role of social, economical and cultural parameters in the land-use organisation and the landscape shaping of high mountain spaces since Prehistory.

The study area consists of the Quaternary-glaciated part of the Coumelade valley (Canigou massif, eastern Pyrenees, France), which ranges between 1450 and 2731 m a.s.l. A topographical-map-derived Digital Elevation Model was used for analyzing glacial landforms by extracting the slope gradient, valley profiles and the slope aspect. The results were gradually refined from the interpretations of aerial photograph and the field investigation. Glacial landforms are present above 1500 m a.s.l. and include glacial and nivation cirques, cirque and latero-frontal moraines (7.7 x 10(6) m(3)) and micro-scale landforms such as chattermarks, crescent grooves and polished surfaces. The geomorphological investigation reveals that the Quaternary glaciation of the Coumelade valley remained limited, resulting in a low denudation rate of 0.011 mm yr(-1) over the last glacial cycle.

Its closure started in the Early Cretaceous, as subduction of the oceanic crust beyond the Austroalpine plate. The sedimentary change on the Austroalpine shelf from pelagic carbonates into deep-water siliciclastics correlated with the denudation of the accretionary wedge resulting from that subduction. Within the Bajuvaric Unit of the Upper Austroalpine, this transition is reflected by the lithostratigraphic boundary between the older Schrambach and the younger Tannheim Formation. This boundary is well exposed in a newly discovered site at Sittendorf, southwest of Vienna. This new outcrop yields an extraordinarily rich planktonic foraminifera assemblage characterized by typical Aptian species belonging to Blowiella, Globigerinelloides, Hedbergella, Leupoldina, and Praehedbergella. A detailed biostratigraphic analysis based on thin-section investigations precisely dated the lithostratigraphic boundary within the lower part of the early Aptian Leupoldina cabri Acme Zone, having an approximate age of 123 Ma. Along with the biostratigraphic analyses, the gamma-log outcrop measurement was a powerful tool in interpreting the stratigraphy and the tectonic setting in the outcrop, which intersects one smaller-scale isoclinal fold.

We report here on a stillborn boy with very large duplication of 7q11.22 -> qter, encompassing almost the entire long arm of chromosome 7. Ultrasound, fetal and parental chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses were performed. Sonographic findings included growth retardation, micrognathia, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic coarctation, bradyarrhythmia, pericardial effusion, bilateral hydronephrosis, infravesical obstruction, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Chromosome analysis after cordocentesis at 23 weeks of gestation revealed an abnormal male karyotype with 46 chromosomes and a derivative chromosome 7 with a very large duplication of the long arm, 46,XY,der(7) (qter -> q11.2::p22 -> qter). The mother was found to carry an apparently balanced pericentric inversion, 46,XX,inv(7)(p22q11.2). Thus, the recombinant chromosome 7 [rec(7)dup(7q)inv(7)(p22.3q11.22)mat] of the fetus must have arisen through meiotic crossing-over between the inverted chromosome and the normal chromosome 7 in the maternal germline. FISH and array CGH results confirmed the recombinant chromosome 7 in the fetus and indicated a loss of 1.9 Mb at chromosome 7pter -> p22.3 (pter to 1,948,072 - bp), and a gain of 87.04 Mb at chromosome 7q11.22 -> qter (71,760,154 bp to qter).

The understanding of the molecular mechanisms of BCC formation, which is a prerequisite for the development of efficient new therapies, is still incomplete. The formation of sporadic BCCs in the skin is associated with uncontrolled hedgehog signaling, and the transcription factor Gli2 has been identified as a key mediator or effector of this signaling. There is indication in the literature that preventing Gli2 function may inhibit BCC formation and growth in vivo; however, the mechanism is unclear and difficult to study in humans. Therefore, we used a mouse tumor allograft model to investigate the role of Gli2 in tumor formation. A constitutively Gli2 expressing mouse tumor cell line was stably transfected with Gli2-specific shRNA to induce Gli2 gene silencing or with control shRNA. Injecting the Gli2 gene silenced cells into nude mice for tumor formation we detected a strongly retarded tumor growth compared with control tumor cells. Investigating the mechanisms, we found that Gli2 gene silencing has led to the disruption of the tumor structure as demonstrated by staining tumor sections with hematoxylin. Two main reasons for the tumor destruction were identified. We found that apoptosis was markedly increased while vascularization was strongly decreased in these tumors. Thus, important functions of the transcription factor Gli2 in this tumor model are the prevention of apoptosis and the promotion of microvascularization.

Aberrant hedgehog signaling can be oncogenic and drugs that block hedgehog are being tested as anticancer agents. We considered whether hedgehog/Gli signaling may be involved in human bladder transitional cell carcinoma proliferative or invasive behavior. Materials and Methods: We stratified the human bladder transitional cell carcinoma lines RT4 (ATCCC (R)), 253JP, 253BV, UMUC6 and UMUC3 for relative growth rate by cell counting and for in vitro invasiveness by Matrigel (TM) invasion assay. Cells were tested for growth inhibition by the hedgehog blocking drug cyclopamine or the inactive mimic tomatidine. Cell RNA was characterized for hedgehog signaling component expression, including ligands, receptors and signaling mediators, by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Gli2 expression or activity was modified by Gli2 expression lentiviruses or the Gli inhibitor GANT61. We measured effects on proliferation and invasiveness. Results: Cell growth rates and invasiveness were stratified into an equivalent order (RT4 < 243JP < 253BV < UMUC6 < UMUC3). All cells were weakly growth inhibited by tomatidine and cyclopamine. Gli2 was the only hedgehog signaling molecule of which expression correlated with stratification. Manipulation of Gli2 expression or activity significantly affected cell invasiveness. Conclusions: Weak growth suppression by cyclopamine suggests that hedgehog signaling is not involved in bladder cancer cell proliferation but Gli2 expression strongly correlated with invasive behavior. Increased Gli2 expression increased low Gli2 cell invasiveness while Gli inhibition by GANT61 decreased high Gli2 cell invasiveness. Results suggest that Gli2 expression by noncanonical signaling contributes to bladder cancer cell invasiveness.","[Mechlin, Clay W.; Buttyan, Ralph; Levin, Robert M.; Mian, Badar M.] Albany Med Coll, Div Urol, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Mian, Badar M.] Stratton Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Albany, NY USA; [Tanner, Matthew J.; Chen, Mengqian; Buttyan, Ralph] Ordway Res Inst Inc,","; data\_id:GSE1434; data\_collection\_article:Eichberger T, Sander V, Schnidar H, Regl G et al.

Recently, we described that HH signaling proteins are commonly expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); however, the functional role of HH pathway in DLBCL has not been explored. Here, we assessed the possibility that HH pathway activation contributes to the survival of DLBCL. We found that HH signaling inhibition induces predominantly cell-cycle arrest in DLBCL cells of germinal center (GC) B-cell type, and apoptosis in DLBCL cells of activated B-cell (ABC) type. Apoptosis after HH signaling inhibition in DLBCL cells of ABC type was associated with downregulation of BCL2; however HH inhibition was not associated with BCL2 downregulation in DLBCL of GC type. Functional inhibition of BCL2 significantly increased apoptosis induced by HH inhibition in DLBCL cells of both types. We also showed that DLBCL cells synthesize, secrete and respond to endogenous HH ligands, providing support for the existence of an autocrine HH signaling loop. Our findings provide novel evidence that dysregulation of HH pathway is involved in the biology of DLBCL and have significant therapeutic implications as they identify HH signaling as a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL, in particular for those lymphomas expressing the HH receptor smoothened.

However, the utility of such cells is restricted due to the difficulty in storing them non-frozen for an extended time and still maintaining their stability and responsiveness. In order to extend the active life span of a mammalian biosensor cell line at room and refrigerated temperatures, we have over expressed genes that are reported to provide protection from apoptosis, stress, or oxidation. We demonstrated that over expression of genes from the extremophile, Artemia franciscana, as well as GADD45 beta, extends room-temperature storage of fully active cells 3.5-fold, while over production of several antiapoptotic proteins extended 4 C storage 2- to 3-fold. Methodologies like these that improve the stability of mammalian-cell-based technologies in the absence of freezers may enable widespread use of these tools in applications that have been considered impractical based solely on limited storage characteristics.

Cytokine production (specifically IFN-gamma) activated a Gadd45 alpha/p3g pathway that led to increased AP-1 (c-jun and ATF3) transcription factor levels, augmenting cytokine production in an autocrine fashion. Whereas HFF-2 aggregates were capable of surviving long term arrest and recovery during NF-kappa B inhibition independent of JNK activation, T98G aggregates were not. Such endogenous processes are not easily observed with adherent monolayer cell culturing systems, strongly suggesting that more emphasis needs to be placed on determining the operational signal transduction cascades within multicellular aggregates. Extracellular inputs such as spheroid formation, arrest, and regrowth as monolayers invoke intracellular signaling responses converging at the AP-1 transcription factor level. Variations in responses are both cell type and transformation state dependent and require an autocrine cytokine component. The data are discussed in relation to the wounding response and avascular tumor growth mechanisms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that infiltrated Th1 cells in the synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients are resistant to apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that Th1 cells accumulated in patient SF expressed a high level of GADD45 beta (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible 45 beta) which further inhibited Th1 cell apoptosis. Interestingly, in vitro culture of T cells with SF from RA patients increased GADD45 beta expression in Th1 cells and inhibited their apoptosis. Silencing of GADD45 beta by RNAi abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of RA SF, which was accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regula tion of Bax. Further analysis showed that TNF-alpha and IL-12 in RA SF could stimulate GADD45 beta expression in Th1 cells and inhibit their apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which specific cytokines in the RA SF elevate GADD45 beta expression in local Th1 cells and subsequently leading to the enhanced T cell survival.

Cell death occurred with a relatively low concentration of menadione in myoblasts compared to myotubes. With the same concentration of menadione, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased and nuclei containing condensed chromatin were observed in myoblasts to a greater extent than in myotubes. However, myotubes became increasingly susceptible to menadione when phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) was blocked by pre-incubation with LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor. Actually, PI3-K activity was reduced by menadione in myoblasts but not in myotubes. In addition, the phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3-K, was inhibited in myoblasts by menadione but increased in myotubes. Both LY294002 and API-2, an Akt inhibitor, decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in menadione-exposed myotubes.

OR-1896 was given orally to Dahl/Rapp SS rats on high-salt diet (NaCl 7\% w/w) for 7 weeks at two different doses (0.5 and 0.05 mg/kg). OR-1896 prevented salt-induced cardiovascular mortality (survival rate 75\% in OR-1896 treated groups vs 38\% in untreated controls, p<0.01), ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and improved systolic functions of the heart without major influence on systemic blood pressure. OR-1896 also ameliorated salt-induced increase in cardiac ANP mRNA expression and plasma BNP level. Salt-induced cardiac remodelling was associated with 4-fold increase in cardiac p16(INK4a) mRNA expression, a marker of cellular senescence. OR-1896 dose-dependently ameliorated cardiomyocyte senescence. Our findings suggest a therapeutic role for OR-1896 in the prevention of cardiac remodelling in salt-sensitive forms of hypertension.

DTGR had increased blood pressure at week 5 that increased further by week 7. Albuminuria was absent at week 5 but increased markedly in weeks 6 and 7. C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation, macrophages, T cells, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, C1q, C3, C3c, and C5b-9 expression preceded albuminuria. C1q, C3, C3c, and C5b-9 were observed in the dTGR vessel media. C5b-9 colocalized with interleukin (IL)-6. Losartan and aliskiren reduced albuminuria and complement expression. We also studied vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from dTGR compared VSMC from SD. C3 and IL-6 mRNA were analyzed after Ang II, TNF-alpha, and CRP stimulation. VSMC from dTGR showed increased proliferation and C3 expression compared with SD. Ang II did not induce C3 mRNA in either VSMC type. However, TNF-alpha and CRP induced C3 mRNA slightly in SD VSMC but markedly in dTGR VSMC, whereas IL-6 induction was similar in both. Thus, complement activation and cell infiltration occurred before the onset of albuminuria in Ang II-mediated renal damage. TNF-alpha and CRP played a major role in C3 activation. VSMC from dTGR are more sensitive for C3 activation. Our data show that, in this Ang II-induced model, complement activation is a major participant and suggest that TNF-alpha and CRP may play a role in its induction.","Charite, Fac Med, Berlin, Germany; Franz Volhard Clin, Berlin, Germany; HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Berlin, Germany; Hannover Med Sch, D-3000 Hannover, Germany; PHILADELPHIA; 530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-326","; data\_id:GSE1557; data\_collection\_article:Wellner M, Dechend R, Park JK, Shagdarsuren E et al.

These filaments first appear throughout the oocyte at the end of prophase and are disassembled after egg activation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We showed here that Mps1 and Polo proteins undergo dynamic and reversible localization to static ooplasmic filaments as part of an oocyte-specific response to hypoxia. The observation that Mps1- and Polo-associated filaments reappear in the same locations through multiple cycles of oxygen deprivation demonstrates that underlying structural components of the filaments must still be present during normoxic conditions. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we observed triple-helical binding of Mps1 to numerous electron-dense filaments, with the gold label wrapped around the outside of the filaments like a garland. In addition, we showed that in live oocytes the relocalization of Mps1 and Polo to filaments is sensitive to injection of collagenase, suggesting that the structural components of the filaments are composed of collagen-like fibrils. However, the collagen-like genes we have been able to test so far (vkg and CG42453) did not appear to be associated with the filaments, demonstrating that the collagenase-sensitive component of the filaments is one of a number of other Drosophila proteins bearing a collagenase cleavage site. Finally, as hypoxia is known to cause Mps1 protein to accumulate at kinetochores in syncytial embryos, we also show that GFP-Polo accumulates at both kinetochores and centrosomes in hypoxic syncytial embryos. Conclusions/Significance: These findings identify both a novel cellular structure (the ooplasmic filaments) as well as a new localization pattern for Mps1 and Polo and demonstrate that hypoxia affects Polo localization in Drosophila.","SAN FRANCISCO; 185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA","; data\_id:GSE1707; data\_collection\_article:Bonde P, Sui G, Dhara S, Wang J et al.

Nonesterified fatty acids originate from lipolysis in white adipose tissue, hydrolysis of VLDL triglycerides, or hydrolysis of intramyocellular triglyceride stores. A key enzyme in the mobilization of fatty acids from intracellular lipid stores is hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic response of HSL-null mice challenged with exercise or fasting and to examine whether other lipases are able to fully compensate for the lack of HSL. The results showed that HSL-null mice have reduced capacity to perform aerobic exercise. The liver glycogen stores were more rapidly depleted in HSL-null mice during treadmill exercise, and HSL-null mice had reduced plasma concentrations of both glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids after exercise and fasting, respectively. The data support the hypothesis that in the absence of HSL, mice are not able to respond to an exercise challenge with increased mobilization of the lipid stores. Consequently, the impact of the lipid-sparing effect on liver glycogen is reduced in the HSL-null mice, resulting in faster depletion of this energy source, contributing to the decreased endurance during submaximal exercise.","[Fernandez, Celine; Holm, Cecilia; Klint, Cecilia] Lund Univ, Dept Expt Med Sci, SE-22184 Lund, Sweden; [Hansson, Ola] Lund Univ, Malmo Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Sci, Malmo, Sweden; [Nevsten, Pernilla] Lund Univ, Natl Ctr High Resolut Elect Microscopy, Lund, S","; data\_id:GSE1772; data\_collection\_article:Hansson O, Donsmark M, Ling C, Nevsten P et al.

In the current study, we investigated whether selective activation of hepatic CB2 modifies collagen abundance in cirrhotic rats with ascites. mRNA and protein expression of CB receptors in the liver of control and cirrhotic rats was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The effect of chronically activating the CB2 receptor was investigated in cirrhotic rats with ascites treated daily (9 days) with the CB2 receptor-selective agonist 3-(1,1-dimethylbutyl)-1-deoxy-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (JWH-133). At the end of treatment, mean arterial pressure and portal pressure were measured, and liver samples were obtained to evaluate infiltrate of mononuclear cells, hepatic apoptosis, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, collagen content, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 abundance in all animals. JWH-133 improved arterial pressure, decreased the inflammatory infiltrate, reduced the number of activated stellate cells, increased apoptosis in non-parenchymal cells located in the margin of the septa, and decreased fibrosis compared with cirrhotic rats treated with vehicle. This was associated with decreased alpha-SMA and collagen I and increased MMP-2 in the hepatic tissue of cirrhotic rats treated with the CB2 agonist compared with untreated cirrhotic animals. Therefore, selective activation of hepatic CB2 receptors significantly reduces hepatic collagen content in rats with pre-existing cirrhosis, thus raising the possibility of using selective CB2 agonists for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis in human cirrhosis.","[Munoz-Luque, Javier; Ros, Josefa; Fernandez-Varo, Guillermo; Tugues, Sonia; Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Jimenez, Wladimiro] Univ Barcelona, Inst Invest Biomed August Pi \& Sunyer, Hosp Clin,Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Hepa, Dept Physiol 1,Biochem \& Mol G","; data\_id:GSE1843; data\_collection\_article:Tugues S, Morales-Ruiz M, Fernandez-Varo G, Ros J et al.

Although current studies have focused on the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Cdc2p that is regulated by these checkpoint kinases, other aspects of their functions at the onset of S phase arrest have not been fully understood. In this study, we use genome-wide DNA microarray analyses to show that HU-induced change of expression profiles in synchronized G(2) cells occurs specifically at the onset of S phase arrest. Induction of many core environmental stress response genes and repression of ribosomal genes happen during S phase arrest. Significantly, peak expression level of the MluI-like cell cycle box (MCB)-cluster (G,) genes is maintained at the onset of S phase arrest in a Rad3p- and Cds1p-dependent manner. Expression level maintenance of the MCB-cluster is mediated through the accumulation of Rep2p, a putative transcriptional activator of the MBF complex. Conversely, the FKH-cluster (M) genes are repressed during the onset of S phase arrest in a Rad3p-dependent manner. Repression of the FKH-cluster genes is mediated through the decreased levels of one of the putative forkhead transcription factors, Sep1p, but not Fkh2p. Together, our results demonstrate that Rad3p and Cds1p modulate transcriptional response during the onset of S phase arrest.","Genome Inst Singapore, Singapore 118672, Singapore; Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biochem, Singapore 117595, Singapore; BETHESDA; 8120 WOODMONT AVE, STE 750, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2755 USA","; data\_id:GSE1914; data\_collection\_article:Dubacq C, Chevalier A, Courbeyrette R, Petat C et al.

To further investigate the cellular processes affected by Aft1, we identified >70 deletion mutants that are sensitive to perturbations in AFT1 levels using genome-wide synthetic lethal and synthetic dosage lethal screens. Our genetic network reveals that Aft1 affects a diverse range of cellular processes, including the RIM101 pH pathway, cell-wall stability, DNA damage, protein transport, chromosome stability, and mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, only a subset of mutants identified are sensitive to extracellular iron fluctuations or display genetic interactions with mutants of iron regulon genes AFT2 or FET3. We demonstrate that Aft1 works in parallel with the RIM101 pH pathway and the role of Aft1 in DNA damage repair is mediated by iron.

Little is understood about the interaction of DDR1 with collagen and its possible functional implications. Here, we elucidate the binding pattern of the DDR1 extracellular domain (ECD) to collagen type 1 and its impact on collagen fibrillogenesis. Our in vitro assays utilized DDR1-Fc fusion proteins, which contain only the ECD of DDR1. Using surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that further oligomerization of DDR1-Fc (by means of anti-Fc antibody) greatly enhances its binding to immobilized collagen type 1. Single-molecule imaging by means of atomic force microscopy revealed that DDR1 oligomers bound at overlapping or adjacent collagen molecules and were nearly absent on isolated collagen molecules. Interaction of DDR1 oligomers with collagen was found to modulate collagen fibrillogenesis both in vitro and in cell-based assays. Collagen fibers formed in the presence of DDR1 had a larger average diameter, were more cross-linked and lacked the native banded structure. The presence of DDR1 ECD resulted in ""locking"" of collagen molecules in an incomplete fibrillar state both in vitro and on surfaces of cells overexpressing DDRI. Our results signify an important functional role of the DDR1 ECD, which occurs naturally in kinase-dead isoforms of DDR1 and as a shedded soluble protein.

In particular, we sought to investigate cardiac gene expression changes at the level of individual genes, as well as biological pathways which contain groups of functionally related genes. Utilizing a combination of computational techniques, including Comparative Marker Selection and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we identified a subset of downstream gene targets of the master mitochondrial transcriptional regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-lot (PGC-1 alpha), whose expression is collectively decreased in failing human hearts. We also observed decreased expression of the key PGC-1 alpha regulatory partner, estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR alpha). as well as ERR alpha target genes which may participate in the downregulation of mitochondrial metabolic capacity. Gene expression of the antiapoptotic Raf-1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was decreased in failing hearts. Alterations in PGC-1 alpha and ERR alpha target gene sets were significantly correlated with an important clinical parameter of disease severity - left ventricular ejection fraction, and were predictive of failing vs. non-failing phenotypes. Overall, our results implicate PGC-1 alpha and ERR alpha in the pathophysiology of human heart failure, and define dynamic target gene sets sharing known interrelated regulatory mechanisms capable of contributing to the mitochondrial dysfunction characteristic of this disease process.

As targeting of etiology-related pathogenic pathways may be more efficient than current standard heart failure treatment, we obtained the genomic expression profile of a DCM subtype characterized by cardiac inflammation to identify possible new therapeutic targets in humans. In this inflammatory cardiomyopathy (DCMi), a distinctive cardiac expression pattern not described in any previous study of cardiac disorders was observed. Two significantly altered gene networks of particular interest and possible interdependence centered around the cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) and adiponectin (APN) gene. CYR61 overexpression, as in human DCMi hearts in situ, was similarly induced by inflammatory cytokines in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. APN was strongly downregulated in DCMi hearts and completely abolished cytokine-dependent CYR61 induction in vitro. Dysbalance between the CYR61 and APN networks may play a pathogenic role in DCMi and contain novel therapeutic targets. Multiple immune cell-associated genes were also deregulated (e.g., chemokine ligand 14, interleukin-17D, nuclear factors of activated T cells). In contrast to previous investigations in patients with advanced or end-stage DCM where etiology-related pathomechanisms are overwhelmed by unspecific processes, the deregulations detected in this study occurred at a far less severe and most probably fully reversible disease stage.","Univ Med Berlin, Charite, Dept Cardiol \& Pneumol, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; Univ Med Berlin, Charite, Ctr Cardiovasc Res, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; Univ Med Berlin, Charite, Lab Funct Genome Res, D-12200 Berlin, Germany; NEW YORK; 233 SPRING STREET, NEW YOR","; data\_id:GSE2014; data\_collection\_article:Beisvag V, Lehre PK, Midelfart H, Aass H et al.

By an integrated genome-transcriptome approach we performed a meta-analysis of data from 74 microarray experiments available on public databases to identify genes with altered expression in the kidney, adrenal, heart, and artery of spontaneously hypertensive and Lyon hypertensive rats. To identify genes responsible for the onset of hypertension we used a statistical approach that sought to eliminate expression differences that occur during maturation unrelated to hypertension. Based on this adjusted fold-difference statistic, we found 36 genes for which the expression differed between the prehypertensive phase and established hypertension. Genes having possible relevance to hypertension onset included Actn2, Ankrd1, ApoE, Cd36, Csrp3, Me1, Myl3, Nppa, Nppb, Pln, Postn, Spp1, Slc21a4, Slc22a2, Thbs4, and Tnni3.

We overexpressed Oct-1 and observed similar to 2.5-fold activation of hPTTG1 promoter luciferase constructs (-2642/- 1 and -1717/-1). Transcriptional activation was abrogated by co-transfection of an inactive Oct-1 form lacking the POU domain or by utilizing mutated hPTTG1 promoters or mutants devoid of two Oct-1-binding motifs (-1717/-1mut, -637/-1 or -433/-1). Using biotin-streptavidin pull-down assays, we confirmed Oct-1 binding to the two octamer motifs in the hPTTG1 promoter (-1669/-1631 and -1401/-1361). Endogenous hPTTG1 mRNA and protein increased up to approximately fourfold in Oct-1 transfectants, as measured by real-time PCR and western blot. In contrast, siRNA-mediated suppression of endogenous Oct-1 attenuated both the hPTTG1 mRNA and protein levels.

Fatty acid composition of maternal RBC at parturition and of milk at d 14 of lactation were determined. Fatty acid composition, villous-crypt structure, and permeability to horseradish peroxidase in Ussing chambers after mast cell degranulation were determined in the ileum of piglets at d 0, 7, and 28. At d 0, 18:3(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) levels were higher, but 22:6(n-3) and 20:4(n-6) levels were lower in both maternal RBC and piglet ileum of the LSO group. Levels of 18:3(n-3) were also higher in the milk of LSO sows. Levels of 18:3(n-3) were higher in LSO piglet ileum at d 7 and 28. Moreover, at d 28, 20:4(n-6) ileal levels tended (P = 0.09) to be lower in LSO than in LAR piglets, in parallel with a lower mRNA expression of Delta 5 desaturase.

We studied the effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated AML1/MTG8 depletion on global gene expression in t(8; 21)- positive leukaemic cell lines and in primary AML blasts using cDNA arrays, oligonucleotide arrays and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Furthermore, expression levels of several genes affiliated with drug resistance or indicative of poor prognosis AML (BAALC, CD34, PRG2, TSPAN7) are affected by AML1/MTG8 depletion.

Feature selection is often used to address this problem by selecting informative genes from among thousands or tens of thousands of genes. However, most of the existing methods of microarray-based cancer classification utilize too many genes to achieve accurate classification, which often hampers the interpretability of the models. For a better understanding of the classification results, it is desirable to develop simpler rule-based models with as few marker genes as possible. Methods: We screened a small number of informative single genes and gene pairs on the basis of their depended degrees proposed in rough sets. Applying the decision rules induced by the selected genes or gene pairs, we constructed cancer classifiers. We tested the efficacy of the classifiers by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) of training sets and classification of independent test sets. Results: We applied our methods to five cancerous gene expression datasets: leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs. acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia (ALL vs. mixed-lineage leukemia [MLL] vs. AML). Accurate classification outcomes were obtained by utilizing just one or two genes. Some genes that correlated closely with the pathogenesis of relevant cancers were identified. In terms of both classification performance and algorithm simplicity, our approach outperformed or at least matched existing methods. Conclusion: In cancerous gene expression datasets, a small number of genes, even one or two if selected correctly, is capable of achieving an ideal cancer classification effect. This finding also means that very simple rules may perform well for cancerous class prediction.","[Wang, Xiaosheng; Gotoh, Osamu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Intelligence Sci \& Technol, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Gotoh, Osamu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci \& Technol, Computat Biol Res Ctr, Tokyo 1350064, Japan; LONDON; 236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC","; data\_id:GSE2191; data\_collection\_article:Yagi T, Morimoto A, Eguchi M, Hibi S et al.

Global hierarchical clustering showed that NC-AMLs are a heterogeneous group. Supervised analysis distinguished two subgroups of NC-AML: one subgroup constituted a homogeneous NC cluster ('pure NC-AML'), and the other NC-AMLs were close to the AML cases with translocations ('translocation like'). Gene expression signatures were also derived for patients with trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and MLL gene duplications. Importantly, samples from 24 NC-AML patients who could be evaluated for clinical outcome were analysed. In all, 43 genes that discriminated two classes of patients with significantly different prognosis were identified. The poor prognosis class contained a majority of 'pure NC-AMLs', whereas the 'translocation-like' AMLs were in the good prognosis class. Discriminator genes included genes involved in drug resistance (TOP2B), protein transport (MTX2, SLC35A2), and cell signalling (MAPK1, PRKAB2).

These findings of decreased BMD rate in the bones of gad mice may suggest that UCH-L1 function regulates bone mineralization during osteogenesis.","[Shim, Sehwan; Kwon, Jungkee] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Lab Anim Med, Coll Vet Med, Jeonju 561156, South Korea; [Kwon, Young-Bae] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Inst Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Jeonju 561156, South Korea; [Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr \& L","; data\_id:GSE2208; data\_collection\_article:Liu YZ, Dvornyk V, Lu Y, Shen H et al.

The results indicated that GR variation contributed to the extreme BMD variation in the Chinese. Introduction: The glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) gene is an important candidate gene for BMD regulation in GC-induced osteoporosis (GIO). However, no study has explored the genetic effects of the GR gene on BMD variation in the Chinese population. Materials and Methods: Our sample consisted of 800 unrelated subjects (400 women and 400 men) with extreme age-adjusted hip BMD Z-scores selected from a population composed of 1988 normal adult Chinese Han. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GR gene were genotyped. Both single SNP and haplotype association analyses were conducted. Results: SNP rs1866388 (p(c) = 0.028) was found to be significantly associated with extreme BMD only in men. In both sexes, haplotypes involving rs1866388 and rs2918419 were found to have different frequency distributions in extremely low and high BMD groups (p(p) = 0.024, 0.001, and 0.002 in women and 0.002, 0.003, and 0.003 in men for window sizes of two, three, and four SNPs, respectively). Most shared haplotypes showed opposite effects between women and men. Conclusions: For the first time, our study suggested the possible role of the GR gene on BMD regulation and sex specificity in the association of GR with extreme BMD in the Chinese.","[Lei, Shu-Feng; Deng, Hong-Wen] Hunan Normal Univ, Lab Mol \& Stat Genet, Coll Life Sci, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yu-Mei; Guo, Yan; Yan, Han; Wang, Liang; Guo, Yan-Fang; Deng, Hong-Wen] Xian Jiaotong Univ, Sch Life Sci \& Technol, Key","; data\_id:GSE2208; data\_collection\_article:Liu YZ, Dvornyk V, Lu Y, Shen H et al.

The aim of this study was to examine whether serum levels of a spectrum of cytokines were predictive of radiographic progression in early RA patients. Methods A total of 82 early RA patients (disease duration < 1 year) were followed for 12 months. Clinical assessments, X-rays of hands and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dominant wrist were assessed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The X-rays were scored according to the van der Heijde modified Sharp score (vdHSS). Cytokine analyses were performed with multiplex technology. Associations between cytokines and radiographic progression were examined by logistic regression. Results In all, 49\% of the patients developed radiographic progression. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) baseline eotaxin level (pg/ml) was significantly lower in patients with (193 (119 to 247)) than without progression (265 (166 to 360)). In the univariate logistic regression analyses, eotaxin was negatively associated to radiographic progression, and this association was maintained in the multivariate model with an odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) for progression of 0.58 (0.41 to 0.82) per 50 pg/ml increase in eotaxin level. None of the other measured cytokines showed any association to radiographic progression. Conclusion This study raises the hypothesis that high serum levels of eotaxin predict less radiographic progression in early RA patients.","[Syversen, Silje W.; Goll, Guro L.; Haavardsholm, Espen A.; Boyesen, Pernille; Kvien, Tore K.] Diakonhjemmet Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, Oslo, Norway; [Syversen, Silje W.; Haavardsholm, Espen A.; Boyesen, Pernille; Kvien, Tore K.] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Oslo, Norw","; data\_id:GSE2208; data\_collection\_article:Liu YZ, Dvornyk V, Lu Y, Shen H et al.

However, the action of tanshinone IIA in inflammatory bone-resorptive diseases remains unknown. Here we examined the effect of tanshinone IIA in inflammation-mediated osteoclastic bone resorption. Tanshinone IIA inhibited osteoclast differentiation in cocultures of bone marrow cells and calvarial osteoblasts. Tanshinone IIA regulated the expression of receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand and osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Also, tanshinone IIA inhibited prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) synthesis by inhibiting Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by LPS. Furthermore, tanshinone IIA greatly suppressed bone loss in the mouse models of bone loss. Our findings suggest that tanshinone IIA inhibits osteoclast formation by inhibiting COX-2/PGE(2) signaling and by suppressing bone erosion in vivo. These results suggest that tanshinone IIA may be of therapeutic value as an anti-bone-resorptive drug in the treatment of bone-related disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that exogenous and intrinsic AID-induced DNA strand breaks activate ATM, which signals through an LKB1 intermediate to inactivate CRTC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB. Using genome-wide location analysis, we determined that CRTC2 inactivation unexpectedly represses a genetic program that controls GC B cell proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation while opposing lymphomagenesis. Inhibition of this pathway results in increased GC B cell proliferation, reduced antibody secretion, and impaired terminal differentiation. Multiple distinct pathway disruptions were also identified in human GC B cell lymphoma patient samples.

As time progresses, computational power increases but well-established inference methods often remain locked in their initial suboptimal solution. Results: We revisit the approach of Segal et al. to infer regulatory modules and their condition-specific regulators from gene expression data. In contrast to their direct optimization-based solution, we use a more representative centroid-like solution extracted from an ensemble of possible statistical models to explain the data. The ensemble method automatically selects a subset of most informative genes and builds a quantitatively better model for them. Genes which cluster together in the majority of models produce functionally more coherent modules. Regulators which are consistently assigned to a module are more often supported by literature, but a single model always contains many regulator assignments not supported by the ensemble. Reliably detecting condition-specific or combinatorial regulation is particularly hard in a single optimum but can be achieved using ensemble averaging.","[Joshi, Anagha; Van de Peer, Yves; Michoel, Tom] Univ Ghent VIB, Dept Plant Syst Biol, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Joshi, Anagha; Van de Peer, Yves; Michoel, Tom] Univ Ghent, Dept Mol Genet, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Marchal, Kathleen] KULeuven, ESAT SCD, B-300","; data\_id:GSE2350; data\_collection\_article:Basso K, Margolin AA, Stolovitzky G, Klein U et al.

In the colon mucosa, steady-state mRNA expression levels of approximately 10,000 genes were compared between both groups by micro-array analysis (MWG rat 10 K array). A total of 8846 mRNAs were detected above background level. Regular exercise led to a decreased expression of 47 genes at a threshold-factor of 2.0. Three genes were found to be up-regulated in the exercise group. The identified genes encode proteins involved in signal transduction (n = 11), transport (n = 8), immune system (n = 7), cytoskeleton (n = 6), protein targeting (n = 6), metabolism (n = 5), transcription (n = 3) and vascularization (n = 2). Among the genes regulated by regular exercise, the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2) seems to be of particular interest. Physical activity may protect against aberrant methylation by repressing the BHMT2 gene and thus contribute to a decreased risk of developing colon cancer. We have also identified vascular endothelial, growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) and calcium-independent phospholipase a2 (iPL-A2), all of them with markedly reduced transcript levels in the mucosa of active rats. In summary, our experiment presents the first gene expression pattern in rat colon mucosa following regular treadmill activity and represents an important step in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the preventive effect of physical activity on the development of colon cancer.

We have previously described a synthetic L1 element, ORFeus, containing two synonymously recoded ORFs relative to mouse L1. It is significantly more active for retrotransposition in cell culture than all native L1 elements tested. To study its activity in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse model in which ORFeus expression was controlled by a constitutive heterologous promoter, and we established definitive evidence for ORFeus retrotransposition activity both in germ line and somatic tissues. Germ line retrotransposition frequencies resulting in 0.33 insertions per animal are seen among progeny of ORFeus donor element heterozygotes derived from a single founder, representing a > 20-fold increase over native L1 elements. We observe somatic transposition events in 100\% of the ORFeus donor-containing animals, and an average of 17 different insertions are easily recovered from each animal; modeling suggests that the number of somatic insertions per animal exceeds this number by perhaps several orders of magnitude. Nearly 200 insertions were precisely mapped, and their distribution in the mouse genome appears random relative to transcription units and guanine-cytosine content. The results suggest that ORFeus may be developed into useful tools for in vivo mutagenesis.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, High Throughput Biol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet \& Mol Biol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; WASHINGTON; 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","; data\_id:GSE2499; data\_collection\_article:Muotri AR, Chu VT, Marchetto MC, Deng W et al.

We collated a large number of published expression studies on mouse haemopoietic cell lineages comprising 304 cell samples from 29 independent experiments performed on a single microarray platform (Affymetrix MOE430-2). The data were subjected to network-based cluster analysis using Biolayout Express(3D). Genes with related function clustered together in distinct regions of the graph reaffirming many known associations between gene expression and role in specific pathways and defining most major cell types of the immune system. Promoters of genes within individual clusters were distinguished by over-representation of regulatory motifs recognised by specific transcription factors. However, these data indicate that commonly used myeloid subpopulation markers, such as CD11c (Itgax), do not correlate with expression of other genes, and further bring into question their use in defining myeloid cell lineage, activation (M1 vs. M2) and antigen-presenting cell function. In particular, there were few mRNA markers that clearly distinguished classical dendritic cells (DC) from macrophages, other than low expression of genes required for phagocytic activity. Bone marrow-derived DC, grown in GM-CSF, were clearly identified as phagocytes and distinguished from isolated lymphoid tissue DC. Thus, through pooling datasets from public data and examining the gene expression clusters within, we can learn a great deal about the transcriptional networks that underpin the differences in functional activities between cell populations of the immune system.

Primary melanocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal wild-type mice and congenic animals heterozygous for Mitf mutations Mitf (mi-vga9/+) and Mitf(Mi-wh/+) and exposed to UV irradiation. Wild-type melanocytes were more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than melanocytes partially deficient in Mitf activity, as determined by relative levels of intracellular melanin and relative activation of Mitf target genes Tyr, Tyrp1, Dct, and Cdk2. Comparative experiments with wild-type cells and congenic albino melanocytes demonstrated that these differences are not due to differences in melanin content, implicating Mitf as a primary determinant of UV-dependent melanocyte survival. Mitf activity correlated directly with resistance to UV-induced apoptosis in melanocytes. Mitf was important not only for regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 following UV irradiation, but also the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bad protein and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Hence, Mitf is a multifaceted regulator of UV-induced apoptosis in melanocytes.","[Hornyak, Thomas J.; Jiang, Shunlin] NCI, Dermatol Branch, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Guzman, Esther A.; Scissors, Beth N.; Tuchinda, Chinisada; He, Hongbin; Neville, James D.; Strickland, Faith M.] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Dept Dermatol, De","; data\_id:GSE2520; data\_collection\_article:Garraway LA, Widlund HR, Rubin MA, Getz G et al.

We mapped these chimeric transcripts to base-pair resolution and traced them to their genomic origins using matched chromosomal copy number information. We also used these data to discover and validate base-pair mutations that accumulated in these melanomas, revealing a surprisingly high rate of somatic mutation and lending support to the notion that point mutations constitute the major driver of melanoma progression.

Polymorphisms present in the probetarget sequences have been shown to alter probe- hybridization affinities, leading to reduced signal intensity measurements and resulting in false-positive results. Here, we characterize this effect on exon and gene expression estimates derived from the Affymetrix Exon Array. We conducted an association analysis between expression levels of probes, exons and transcripts and the genotypes of neighboring SNPs in 57 CEU HapMap individuals. We quantified the dependence of the effect of genotype on signal intensity with respect to the number of polymorphisms within target sequences, number of affected probes and position of the polymorphism within each probe. The effect of SNPs is quite severe and leads to considerable false-positive rates, particularly when the analysis is performed at the exon level and aimed at detecting alternative splicing events. Finally, we propose simple solutions, based on masking probes, which are putatively affected by polymorphisms and show that such strategy results in a large decrease in false-positive rates, with a very modest reduction in coverage of the transcriptome.","[Benovoy, David; Kwan, Tony; Majewski, Jacek] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benovoy, David; Kwan, Tony; Majewski, Jacek] Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; OXFORD; GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","; data\_id:GSE2552; data\_collection\_article:Cheung VG, Spielman RS, Ewens KG, Weber TM et al.

We investigated such gene expression variation by analyzing expression profiles in brain tissues derived from eight different brain regions and from blood in 12 monkeys from a biomedically important non-human primate model, the vervet (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). We characterized brain regional differences in gene expression, focusing on transcripts for which inter-individual variation of expression in brain correlates well with variation in blood from the same individuals. Using stringent criteria, we identified 29 transcripts whose expression is measurable, stable, replicable, variable between individuals, relevant to brain function and heritable. Polymorphisms identified in probe regions could, in a minority of transcripts, confound the interpretation of the observed inter-individual variation. The high heritability of levels of these transcripts in a large vervet pedigree validated our approach of focusing on transcripts that showed higher inter-individual compared with intra-individual variation. These selected transcripts are candidate expression Quantitative Trait Loci, differentially regulating transcript levels in the brain among individuals. Given the high degree of conservation of tissue expression profiles between vervets and humans, our findings may facilitate the understanding of regional and individual transcriptional variation and its genetic mechanisms in humans. The approach employed here-utilizing higher quality tissue and more precise dissection of brain regions than is usually possible in humans-may therefore provide a powerful means to investigate variation in gene expression relevant to complex brain related traits, including human neuropsychiatric diseases.","[Freimer, Nelson B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Neurobehav Genet, Gonda Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jentsch, J.

Identification of genes and gene networks specifying either sternness or commitment will not only be of major relevance for a fundamental understanding of developmental biology, but also for the emerging fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Our appreciation of the transcriptional machinery that distinguishes stem cells from their nonstem cell progeny is, however, rudimentary. State-of-the art genome-wide tools are now becoming available to elucidate intrinsic properties of stem cells. Here, we review recent progress that has been made in this field. Recent findings Approaches to study stem cell-specific genes and gene networks include genetical genomics, mRNA and microRNA expression profiling of carefully selected cells, proteomics, chromatin studies using 'CHIP-on-chip' tools, genome-wide binding site analyses for transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling proteins, and tools to study the three-dimensional organization of gene loci. It is promising to see that the combined application of these tools has resulted in the identification of multiple novel genes that regulate stem cell self-renewal. Summary Exploitation of the available technology and integrating the data by translation into a dynamic model of networks, operating in all four dimensions, will be essential to fully comprehend the elusive concept of 'stemness'.

This incomplete penetrance is poorly understood and is usually attributed to interactions between genes or interactions between genes and environmental conditions. Because many traits such as cancer can emerge from rare events happening in one or very few cells, we speculate an alternative and complementary possibility where some genotypes could facilitate these events by increasing stochastic cell-to-cell variations ( or 'noise'). As a very first step towards investigating this possibility, we studied how natural genetic variation influences the level of noise in the expression of a single gene using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Reproducible differences in noise were observed between divergent genetic backgrounds. We found that noise was highly heritable and placed under a complex genetic control. Scanning the genome, we mapped three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) of noise, one locus being explained by an increase in noise when transcriptional elongation was impaired. Our results suggest that the level of stochasticity in particular molecular regulations may differ between multicellular individuals depending on their genotypic background. The complex genetic architecture of noise buffering couples genetic to non-genetic robustness and provides a molecular basis to the probabilistic nature of complex traits.","[Ansel, Juliet; Bottin, Helene; Damon, Christelle; Nagarajan, Muniyandi; Fehrmann, Steffen; Yvert, Gael] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France; [Ansel, Juliet; Bottin, Helene; Damon, Christelle; Nagarajan, Muniyandi; Fehrmann, Steffen; Yvert, Gael] CNRS, Ecole Normale","; data\_id:GSE2552; data\_collection\_article:Cheung VG, Spielman RS, Ewens KG, Weber TM et al.

Both homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens were studied. In most cases, both higher CD8(+) T cell responses and better tumor protections were observed in mice immunized with heterologous prime-boost regimens, suggesting that the combination of different viral vectors is beneficial for the induction of an effective immune response. However, homologous immunization with SFV provided potent tumor protection despite a rather moderate primary CD8(+) T cell response as compared with mice immunized with recombinant adenovirus. SFV-immunized mice showed a rapid and more extensive expansion of P1A-specific CD8(+) T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node after tumor challenge and had a higher frequency of CD62L(+) P1A-specific T cells in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes as compared with adenoimmunized mice.

Our findings indicate that TiO2 NPs lead to a differentiational tendency towards neurons from neural stem cells, suggesting TiO2 NPs might be a beneficial inducer for neuronal differentiation. To insight into the possible molecular mechanism of the neuronal differentiation, we conducted a protein-protein interaction network (PIN) analysis. To this end, a global mapping of target proteins induced by TiO2 NPs was first made by a 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis. Results showed that 9 proteins were significantly changed and then they were subjected to the mass spectrometric assay. All 9 identified proteins are involved in signal, molecular chaperones, cytoskeleton, and nucleoprotein. Further, based on our experimental data and DIP, IntAct-EBI, GRID database, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed, which provides highly integrated information exhibiting the protein-protein interaction. By analysis of the gene expression, the signal pathway involving Cx43 phosphotylation, which is negatively regulated by the protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon), is demonstrated. It is inferred that PKCE plays a pivotal negative role in the neuronal differentiation of stem neural cells in response to the TiO2 NPs exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although extensive studies have been carried out to assess the molecular features of NCI60 cell lines related to cancer and their sensitivities to more than 100,000 chemical compounds, it remains unclear if and how well these cell lines represent or model their tumor tissues of origin. Identification and confirmation of correct origins of NCI60 cell lines are critical to their usage as model systems and to translate in vitro studies into clinical potentials. Here we report a direct comparison between NCI60 cell lines and primary tumors by analyzing global gene expression profiles. Results: Comparative analysis suggested that 51 of 59 cell lines we analyzed represent their presumed tumors of origin. Taking advantage of available clinical information of primary tumor samples used to generate gene expression profiling data, we further classified those cell lines with the correct origins into different subtypes of cancer or different stages in cancer development. For example, 6 of 7 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were classified as lung adenocarcinomas and all of them were classified into late stages in tumor progression. Conclusion: Taken together, we developed and applied a novel approach for systematic comparative analysis and integrative classification of NCI60 cell lines and primary tumors. Our results could provide guidance to the selection of appropriate cell lines for cancer research and pharmaceutical compound screenings. Moreover, this gene expression profile based approach can be generally applied to evaluate experimental model systems such as cell lines and animal models for human diseases.","Eli Lilly \& Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Integrat Biol, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; Eli Lilly \& Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Global Discovery \& Dev Stat, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; Eli Lilly \& Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Canc Discov","; data\_id:GSE2603; data\_collection\_article:Minn AJ, Gupta GP, Siegel PM, Bos PD et al.

We wanted to test its expression pattern in human tumors and to evaluate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses in healthy humans after in vitro immunizations. Experimental Design: Expression of SPANX-B in human malignancies, including a multitumor tissue array of 145 primary tumors, was assessed using reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis. T-cell immunogenicity and immunodominant epitopes of SPANX-B were studied using in vitro immunizations of healthy human donor-derived leukocytes. Results: SPANX-B was abundantly expressed in melanoma and carcinomas of lung, ovary, colon, and breast. In melanoma, tissue array data indicated that it was expressed in advanced and metastatic disease. Unlike most tumor-associated antigens, SPANX-B was an immunogenic antigen that was recognized by circulating T-cell precursors in healthy humans. Importantly, these T cells were readily expanded to generate SPANX-B-specific helper CD4(+) and cytolytic CD8(+) T cells that recognized unique immunodominant epitopes: at least one HLA-DR-restricted Pep-9 epitope (SPANX-B12-23) and two H LA-A2-restricted Pep-2 and Pep-4 epitopes (SPANX-B23-31 and SPANX-B57-65, respectively). CD8(+) T cells were fully functional to recognize and lyse HLA-A2-expressing tumors, including primary human melanomas.

However, the high incidence of metastasis from various tumour types in liver and lung may be explained by a stochastic process as well, based on the anatomical relationship of the primary tumour with the circulation and mechanical entrapment of metastatic tumour cells in capillary beds. We previously reported that constitutive VEGF-A expression in tumour xenografts facilitates this type of metastatic seeding by promoting shedding of multicellular tumour tissue fragments, surrounded by vessel wall elements, into the circulation. After transport through the vena cava, such fragments may he trapped in pulmonary arteries, allowing them to expand to symptomatic lesions. Here we tested whether this process has clinical relevance for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a prototype tumour in the sense of high constitutive VEGF-A expression. To this end we collected and analysed outflow samples from the renal vein, directly after tumour nephrectomy, in 42 patients diagnosed with ccRCC. Tumour fragments in venous outflow were observed in 33\% of ccRCC patients and correlated with the synchronous presence or metachronous development of pulmonary metastases (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). In patients with tumours that, in retrospect, were not of the VEGF-A-expressing clear cell type, tumour fragments were never observed in the renal outflow.

Recent microarray studies have revealed that expression variation is abundant in many species, including Drosophila melanogaster. However, previous expression surveys in this species generally focused on a small number of laboratory strains established from derived populations. Thus, these studies were not ideal for population genetic analyses. Results: We surveyed gene expression variation in adult males of 16 D. melanogaster strains from two natural populations, including an ancestral African population and a derived European population. Levels of expression polymorphism were nearly equal in the two populations, but a higher number of differences was detected when comparing strains between populations. Expression variation was greatest for genes associated with few molecular functions or biological processes, as well as those expressed predominantly in males. Our analysis also identified genes that differed in expression level between the European and African populations, which may be candidates for adaptive regulatory evolution. Genes involved in flight musculature and fatty acid metabolism were over-represented in the list of candidates. Conclusion: Overall, stabilizing selection appears to be the major force governing gene expression variation within populations. However, positive selection may be responsible for much of the between-population expression divergence. The nature of the genes identified to differ in expression between populations may reveal which traits were important for local adaptation to the European and African environments.","[Hutter, Stephan; Saminadin-Peter, Sarah S.; Stephan, Wolfgang; Parsch, John] Univ Munich, Dept Biol, Sect Evolut Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; LONDON; CURRENT SCIENCE GROUP, MIDDLESEX HOUSE, 34-42 CLEVELAND ST, LONDON W1T 4LB, ENGLAND","; data\_id:GSE2641; data\_collection\_article:Rifkin SA, Houle D, Kim J, White KP.

How external signaling pathways connect to core self-renewal transcriptional circuits is largely unknown. To probe this, we chose BMP signaling, which is previously recognized as a master control for both self-renewal and lineage commitment of murine ES cells. Here, we mapped target gene promoter occupancy of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 on a genome-wide scale and found that they associate with a large group of developmental regulators that are enriched for H3K27 trimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation bivalent marks and are repressed in the self-renewing state, whereas they are rapidly induced upon differentiation. Smad knockdown experiments further indicate that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling is largely required for differentiation-related processes rather than directly influencing self-renewal. Among the SMAD-associated genes, we further identified Dpysl2 (previously known as Crmp2) and the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b (previously known as Jmjd3) as BMP4-modulated early neural differentiation regulators. Combined with computational analysis, our results suggest that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling balances self-renewal versus differentiation by modulating a set of developmental regulators.","[Xia, Kai; Zhou, Bing; Zhu, Shanshan; Chen, Zhang; Han, Jing-Dong J.] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Mol Dev Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xia, Kai; Zhou, Bing; Zhu, Shanshan; Chen, Zhang; Han, Jing-Dong J.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Mol Syst Biol, I","; data\_id:GSE2672; data\_collection\_article:Kim TH, Barrera LO, Zheng M, Qu C et al.

CP190 binding was detected at CTCF, su( Hw) and GAF sites and unexpectedly at the transcriptional start sites of actively transcribed genes. Both insulator and transcription start site CP190-binding elements are strictly marked by a depletion of histone H3 and, therefore, a loss of nucleosome occupancy. In addition, CP190/dCTCF double occupancy was seen at the borders of many H3K27me3 'islands'. As before, these sites were also depleted of H3. Loss of either dCTCF or CP190 causes an increase of H3 and H3K27 trimethylation at these sites.

Marked incorporation of tagged H3.3 into the FR gene is confined to its upstream regulatory region and is observed whether or not the gene is transcriptionally active. Incorporation is also observed over locus control regulatory elements in the absence of transcription of genes regulated by these elements, suggesting that gene activity per se is not necessarily required to replace H3 with H3.3. Other active genes display various behaviors, either incorporating H3.3 over both the coding region and upstream regulatory region or over upstream sequences only. There is, however, no straightforward correlation between sites of H3.3 incorporation and regions of enrichment in H3 acetylation and lysine-4 methylation. In the case of FIR and VEGF-D, in which incorporation is confined to upstream regions, the presence of exogenous H3 results in reduced expression, whereas H3.3 stimulates expression. This finding suggests that these histone variants can be active rather than passive participants in regulation of expression.","NIDDKD, Lab Mol Biol, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; WASHINGTON; 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","; data\_id:GSE2672; data\_collection\_article:Kim TH, Barrera LO, Zheng M, Qu C et al.

For the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolysis or RNA interference-mediated depletion of specific proteasome subunits results in an increase in gene expression. To facilitate transcription, proteasome inhibition alters at least two features associated with modification of chromatin architecture and gene transcription. First, proteasome inhibition increases trimethyl histone H3K4 levels with a corresponding accumulation of this modification on GR-regulated promoters in vivo. Secondly, global levels of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Pol II) increase, together with hormone-dependent association of the phosphorylated Pol II, with the promoter and the body of the activated gene.

Larvae that were fed responded relatively slowly to starvation compared with the rapid response of arrested larvae to feeding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) followed by deep sequencing showed that during L1 arrest, Pol II continued transcribing starvation-response genes, but the enzyme accumulated on the promoters of growth and development genes.

By comparative genomics, we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation.

There is growing evidence that genes that respond to environmental or developmental signals may possess distinct chromatin marks. Using a T cell model and both genome-wide and gene-focused approaches, we examined the chromatin characteristics of genes that respond to T cell activation. Results: To facilitate comparison of genes with similar basal expression levels, we used expression-profiling data to bin genes according to their basal expression levels. We found that inducible genes in the lower basal expression bins, especially rapidly induced primary response genes, were more likely than their non-responsive counterparts to display the histone modifications of active genes, have RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at their promoters and show evidence of ongoing basal elongation. There was little or no evidence for the presence of active chromatin marks in the absence of promoter Pol II on these inducible genes. In addition, we identified a subgroup of genes with active promoter chromatin marks and promoter Pol II but no evidence of elongation. Following T cell activation, we find little evidence for a major shift in the active chromatin signature around inducible gene promoters but many genes recruit more Pol II and show increased evidence of elongation. Conclusions: These results suggest that the majority of inducible genes are primed for activation by having an active chromatin signature and promoter Pol II with or without ongoing elongation.","[Lim, Pek S.; Hardy, Kristine; Ma, Lina; Shannon, Mary F.] Australian Natl Univ, Genome Biol Program, John Curtin Sch Med Res, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia; [Lim, Pek S.; Hardy, Kristine; Ma, Lina; Shannon, Mary F.] Australian Natl Univ, ACRF Biomol Resourc","; data\_id:GSE2672; data\_collection\_article:Kim TH, Barrera LO, Zheng M, Qu C et al.

We obtained partial clones of three heat shock protein (hsp) genes (piac25, hsc70 and hsp90) and confirmed, by comparing deduced amino acid sequences, gene homology with corresponding hsps of other lepidopteran insects. Using Northern blot hybridization, expression levels of each gene were compared in fifth-instar larvae which were irradiated with gamma rays at doses from 0.1 to 2.0 kGy. The transcript level of hsc70 was increased at 0.5 kGy and higher doses, but the piac25 and hsp90 levels did not change. The hsc70 level also increased in irradiated pupae, but needed a 2.0 kGy dose. Mortality of irradiated larvae was also dose-dependent, and all larvae were killed by >= 1 kGy irradiation. Our results show that hsc70, but not piac25 and hsp90, was highly responsive to irradiation and suggest that specific hsp gene(s) may have a potential as molecular markers for the detection of irradiated insects.

The method combines an artificial neural network with a decision tree that is intended to precede standard techniques, such as classification, and enhance their performance and ability to detect cancer genes. First, we used the relief algorithm to select the featured genes that could unravel cancer characteristics out of high dimensional data. Then, an artificial neural network was employed to find the biomarker subsets with the best classification performance for distinguishing cancerous tissues and their counterparts. Next a decision tree expression was used to extract rules subsets from these biomarker sets. Rules induced from the best performance decision tree, in which the branches denote the level of gene expression, were interpreted as a diagnostic model by using previous biological knowledge. Finally, we obtained a gastric cancer diagnosis model for Chinese patients. The results show that using the Chinese gastric biomarker genes with the diagnostic model provides more instruction in biological experiments and clinical diagnosis reference than previous methods.","[Ruan, Xiaogang; Wang, Jinlian] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Elect Informat \& Control Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; NEW YORK; 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","; data\_id:GSE2701; data\_collection\_article:Chen X, Leung SY, Yuen ST, Chu KM et al.

Studies in gastrin null (Gas-KO) mice indicate that maturation of parietal cell function depends on the hormone gastrin acting at the G-protein-coupled cholecystokinin 2 receptor. The relevant cellular mechanisms are unknown. The application of differential mRNA display to samples of the gastric corpus of wild-type (C57BL/6) and Gas-KO mice identified the cytoskeletal linker protein, ezrin, as a previously unsuspected target of gastrin. Gastrin administered in vivo or added to gastric glands in vitro increased ezrin abundance in Gas-KO parietal cells. In parietal cells of cultured gastric glands from wild-type mice treated with gastrin, histamine or carbachol, ezrin was localized to vesicular structures resembling secretory canaliculi. In contrast, in cultured parietal cells from Gas-KO mice, ezrin was typically distributed in the cytosol, and this did not change after incubation with gastrin, histamine or carbachol. However, priming with gastrin for approximately 24 h, either in vivo prior to cell culture or by addition to cultured gastric glands, induced the capacity for secretagogue-stimulated localization of ezrin to large vesicular structures in Gas-KO mice. Similarly, in a functional assay based on measurement of intracellular pH, cultured parietal cells from Gas-KO mice were refractory to gastrin unless primed. The priming effect of gastrin was not attributable to the paracrine mediator histamine, but was prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase C and transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. We conclude that in gastrin null mice there is reduced ezrin expression and a defect in ezrin subcellular distribution in gastric parietal cells, and that both can be reversed by priming with gastrin.","[Pagliocca, Adelina; Rackstraw, Stephen A.; Khan, Zara; Burdyga, Galina; Dimaline, Rod; Varro, Andrea; Dockray, Graham J.] Univ Liverpool, Physiol Lab, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Hegyi, Peter; Venglovecz, Viktoria] Univ Med Sch, Dept Med 1,","; data\_id:GSE2772; data\_collection\_article:Jain RN, Brunkan CS, Chew CS, Samuelson LC.

Previous work demonstrated increases in the expression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1-gamma (Camk1g) mRNA following acute deltamethrin and permethrin exposure. In the rat, this gene is expressed as two distinct splice variants, Camk1g1 and Camk1g2. The present study tests the hypothesis that changes in Camk1g mRNA expression in the rat following acute pyrethroid exposure are due to a specific increase in the Camk1g1 splice variant and not the Camk1g2 splice variant. Long-Evans rats were acutely exposed to permethrin, deltamethrin, or corn oil vehicle. Frontal cortex was collected at 6 h postdosing. In addition, rats were exposed to permethrin (100 mg/kg) or deltamethrin (3 mg/kg), and frontal cortex was collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 h along with time-matched vehicle controls. Expression of Camk1g1 and Camk1g2 mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and quantified using the 2(-Delta Delta C)T method. Dose-dependent increases in Camk1g1 mRNA expression were observed for both pyrethroids at 6 h. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in Camk1g2 was observed at 6 h although it was very small in magnitude. The increases in Camk1g1 expression for deltamethrin and permethrin peak between 3 and 6 h postexposure and returns to control levels by 9 h. There was no increase in CAMK1G1 protein as measured with Western blots.

The stabilizing activity of p23 was first characterized in studies of steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes. Earlier studies of the Hsp90 chaperone complex in plants suggested that a p23-like stabilizing activity was absent in plant cell lysates. Here, we show that p23-like proteins are present in plants and are capable of binding Hsp90, but unlike human p23 and yeast ortholog Sba1, the plant p23-like proteins do not stabilize the steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes formed in wheat germ lysate. Furthermore, these proteins do not inhibit the ATPase activity of plant Hsp90. While transcripts of Arabidopsis thaliana p23-1 and Atp23-2 were detected under normal growing conditions, those of the closely related Brassica napus p23-1 were present only after moderate heat stress. These observations suggest that p23-like proteins in plants are conserved in their binding to Hsp90 but have evolved mechanisms of action different from their yeast and animal counterparts.","[Horowitz, Michal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Med Sch, Dept Physiol, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Assayag, Miri; Horowitz, Michal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med Dent, Environm Physiol Lab, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Gerstenblith, Gary] Johns Hopki","; data\_id:GSE2890; data\_collection\_article:Schwimmer H, Eli-Berchoer L, Horowitz M.

This study determined whether exercise-HA modifies the human heat shock protein (HSP) 72 and HSP90 responses and whether changes are correlated with physiological adaptations to HA. Using a 10-day HA protocol comprising daily exercise (treadmill walking) in a hot environment (T-a = 49 degrees C, 20\% RH), we analyzed baseline and ex vivo heat-induced expression of HSP72 and HSP90 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated prior to exercise from eight subjects on day 1 and 10 of the HA protocol. Classical physiological responses to HA were observed, including significantly reduced heart rate and core body temperature, and significantly increased sweating rate. Baseline levels of HSP72 and HSP90 were significantly increased following acclimation by 17.7 +/- 6.1\% and 21.1 +/- 6.5\%, respectively. Ex vivo induction of HSP72 in PBMCs exposed to heat shock (43 C) was blunted on day 10 compared with day 1. A correlation was identified (r(2) = 0.89) between changes in core temperature elevation and ex vivo HSP90 responses to heat shock between days 1 and 10, indicating that volunteers demonstrating the greatest physiological HA tended to exhibit the greatest blunting of ex vivo HSP induction in response to heat shock. In summary, 1) exercise-HA resulted in increased baseline levels of HSP72 and HSP90, 2) ex vivo heat inducibility of HSP72 was blunted after HA, and 3) volunteers demonstrating the greatest physiological HA tended to exhibit the greatest blunting of ex vivo HSP induction in response to heat shock.

Fivefold concentrated fresh PRP is applied to scaffolds loaded with 2 x 10(5) MSC (n = 5). These constructs are kept in a medium with osteogenic supplements for 3 weeks. The addition of PRP leads to a higher cell loading efficiency of MSC on CDHA (p = 0.0001), that reaches the values of beta-TCP. Proliferation over 21 days is improved by PRP both on CDHA (p = 0.0001) and beta-TCP (p = 0.014) compared to MSC/calcium phosphate composites. Without the addition of PRP, CDHA has a lower cell loading efficiency (p = 0.0001) and proliferation (p = 0.001) than beta-TCP. The ALP activity is higher in the MSC/ceramics groups than in the monolayer controls (p < 50.05). The addition of PRP does not significantly affect ALP activity. However, ALP activity varies considerably within the cell donors and different PRP-pools (p = 0.001), while the cell numbers do not vary within these two parameters.

Intra-peritoneal administration of bis(allixinato)oxidovanadium(IV) [VO(alx)(2)] lowers high blood glucose levels in animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have examined whether oral administration of VO(alx)(2) restores impaired activation in signaling cascades related to glucose metabolism and insulin action, and alters gene expression in the skeletal muscles of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice (STZ-diabetic mice). We report here that daily oral administration of VO(alx)(2) lowered high blood glucose levels in the STZ-diabetic mice. The oral administration of VO(alx)(2) enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta), located downstream of the insulin receptor cascade in the skeletal muscles. We analyzed gene expression in the muscles of the diabetic mice before and after insulin or VO(alx)(2) treatment. Treating the diabetic mice with insulin or VO(alx)(2) normalized the gene expression levels of 152 clown-regulated and 11 up-regulated genes, and especially the up-regulation of Cyp2E1 and FoxO1 in the muscles of the diabetic mice. The insulin-mimetic effects of VO(alx)(2) in the STZ-induced diabetic mice may be due to the enhancement of protein phosphorylation leading to the activation or inactivation of the transcriptional machinery. Our findings suggest that the insulin-mimetic effects of VO(alx)(2) in diabetes may be due to changes in the protein phosphorylations and their gene expression levels.","[Hiromura, Makoto; Adachi, Yusuke; Machida, Megumi; Sakurai, Hiromu] Kyoto Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Analyt \& Bioinorgan Chem, Yamashina Ku, Kyoto 6078414, Japan; [Hiromura, Makoto] RIKEN, CMIS, Metall Imaging Res Unit, Chuo Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [H","; data\_id:GSE2899; data\_collection\_article:Lan H, Rabaglia ME, Stoehr JP, Nadler ST et al.

Type 2 diabetes is characterised by excessive hepatic glucose production and frequently leads to systemic vascular complications. We therefore analysed the relationship between the gene expression profile in the liver and the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes. Methods. Liver biopsy samples were obtained from twelve patients with Type 2 diabetes and from nine non-diabetic patients. To assay gene expression globally in the livers of both groups, we made complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays consisting of 1080 human cDNAs. Relative expression ratios of individual genes were obtained by comparing cyanine 5-labelled cDNA from the patients with cyanine 3-labelled cDNA from reference RNA from the liver of a non-diabetic patient. Results. On assessing the similarities of differentially expressed genes, the gene expression profiles of the twelve diabetic patients formed a separate cluster from those of the non-diabetic patients. Of the 1080 genes assayed, 105 (9.7\%) were up-regulated and 134 (12\%) were down-regulated in the diabetic livers (p<0.005). The genes up-regulated in the diabetic patients included those encoding angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin and platelet-derived growth factor. They also included TGF superfamily genes such as TGFA and TGFB1 as well as bone morphogenetic proteins. Among the down-regulated genes in the diabetic patients were molecules defending against stress, e.g. flavin-containing monooxygenase and superoxide dismutase. Conclusions/interpretation. These findings suggest that livers of patients with Type 2 diabetes have gene expression profiles indicative of an increased risk of systemic vascular complications.","Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Diabet \& Digest Dis, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920, Japan; NEW YORK; 175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","; data\_id:GSE2899; data\_collection\_article:Lan H, Rabaglia ME, Stoehr JP, Nadler ST et al.

Recent studies have suggested that a considerable number of genes coding for proteolytic enzymes are present within the E. histolytica genome and questions remain about the mode of expression of the various molecules. Results: By homology search within the recently published amoeba genome, we identified a total of 86 E. histolytica genes coding for putative peptidases, including 46 recently described peptidase genes. In total these comprise (i) 50 cysteine peptidases of different families but most of which belong to the C1 papain superfamily, (ii) 22 different metallo peptidases from at least 11 different families, (iii) 10 serine peptidases belonging to 3 different families, and (iv) 4 aspartic peptidases of only one family. Using an oligonucleotide microarray, peptidase gene expression patterns of 7 different E. histolytica isolates as well as of heat stressed cells were analysed. A total of 21 out of 79 amoeba peptidase genes analysed were found to be significantly expressed under standard axenic culture conditions whereas the remaining are not expressed or at very low levels only. In heat-stressed cells the expression of 2 and 3 peptidase genes, respectively, were either decreased or increased. Only minor differences were observed between the various isolates investigated, despite the fact that these isolates were originated from asymptomatic individuals or from patients with various forms of amoebic diseases. Conclusion: Entamoeba histolytica possesses a large number of genes coding for proteolytic enzymes. Under standard culture conditions or upon heat-stress only a relatively small number of these genes is significantly expressed and only very few variations become apparent between various clinical E. histolytica isolates, calling into question the importance of these enzymes in E. histolytica pathogenicity. Further studies are required to define the precise role of most of the proteolytic enzyme for amoeba cell biology but in particular for E. histolytica virulence.","Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany; Univ Fed Minas Gerais, ICB, Dept Parasitol, Lab Amebiase, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; LONDON; MIDDLESEX HOUSE, 34-42 CLEVELAND ST, LONDON W1T 4LB, ENGLAND","; data\_id:GSE2978; data\_collection\_article:MacFarlane RC, Shah PH, Singh U.

The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica converts between cysts (essential for disease transmission) and trophozoites (responsible for tissue invasion). Identification of genes involved in the developmental pathway has been severely hindered by the inability to generate E. histolytica cysts in vitro. Using parasite strains derived from recent human infections and whole-genome transcriptional profiling, we determined that 1439 genes (similar to 15\% of annotated genes) were potentially developmentally regulated. Genes enriched in cysts (672 in total) included cysteine proteinases and transmembrane protein kinases, which may be involved in signal transduction. Genes enriched in trophozoites (767 in total) included genes typically thought of as important in tissue invasion by trophozoites, including the Gal/GalNAc lectin light subunit and cysteine protease 1. Putative regulators of differentiation including possible G-protein coupled receptors, signal transduction proteins and transcription factors were identified. A number of E. histolytica stage-specific genes were also developmentally regulated in the reptilian parasite E. invadens, indicating that they likely have conserved functions in Entamoeba development.

Virtually all members of the SOX family have been found to be deregulated in a wide variety of tumors. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviors involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Using cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, molecular profiling, and animal studies, we report here that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by facilitating the G(1)/S transition and through its transcription regulation of the CCND1 gene in breast cancer cells. In addition, we identified beta-catenin as the transcription partner for SOX2 and demonstrated that SOX2 and beta-catenin act in synergy in the transcription regulation of CCND1 in breast cancer cells. Our experiments not only determined a role for SOX2 in mammary tumorigenesis but also revealed another activity of the multifunctional protein, beta-catenin.","[Chen, Yupeng; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Lirong; Li, Ruifang; Liang, Jing; Yu, Wenhua; Sun, Luyang; Yang, Xiaohan; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Yu; Shang, Yongfeng] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem \& Mol Biol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; BETHESDA; 9650 ROCKVILLE","; data\_id:GSE3013; data\_collection\_article:Wu H, Chen Y, Liang J, Shi B et al.

We have investigated whether JNKBP1 functions as an adaptor protein for nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation mediated by TAK1 in COS-7 cells. Co-expression experiments showed that JNKBP1 interacted with not only TAK1, but also with its upstream regulators, TNF-receptor associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and TRAF6). An endogenous interaction between JNKBP1 and TRAF2 or TAK1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis. We also found that JNKBP1 could enhance the NF-kappa B activation induced by TAK1 and TRAF2, and could promote TRAF2 polyubiquitination.

As well as causing apoptosis of certain types of tumor cells, TRAIL can activate both NF-kappa B and JNK signalling pathways. To determine the role of TGF-beta-Activated Kinase-1 (TAK1) in TRAIL signalling, we analyzed the effects of adding TRAIL to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from TAK1 conditional knockout mice. TAK1-/- MEFs were significantly more sensitive to killing by TRAIL than wild-type MEFs, and failed to activate NF-kappa B or JNK. Overexpression of IKK2-EE, a constitutive activator of NF-kappa B, protected TAK1-/- MEFs against TRAIL killing, suggesting that TAK1 activation of NF-kappa B is critical for the viability of cells treated with TRAIL. Consistent with this model, TRAIL failed to induce the survival genes cIAP2 and cFlipL in the absence of TAK1, whereas activation of NF-kappa B by IKK2-EE restored the levels of both proteins. Moreover, ectopic expression of cFlipL, but not cIAP2, in TAK1-/- MEFs strongly inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death. These results indicate that cells that survive TRAIL treatment may do so by activation of a TAK1-NF-kappa B pathway that drives expression of cFlipL, and suggest that TAK1 may be a good target for overcoming TRAIL resistance.","[Lluis, Josep Maria; Nachbur, Ulrich; Cook, Wendy Diane; Gentle, Ian Edward; Moujalled, Donia; Moulin, Maryline; Wong, Wendy Wei-Lynn; Khan, Nufail; Chau, Diep; Silke, John; Vaux, David Lawrence] La Trobe Univ, Dept Biochem, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia;","; data\_id:GSE3065; data\_collection\_article:Sato S, Sanjo H, Takeda K, Ninomiya-Tsuji J et al.

It is phosphorylated by at least two upstream kinases, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK) MKK4 and MKK7, which are, in turn, phosphorylated by MEK kinases (MEKKs). However, the MEKKs that are most relevant to JNK activation in synoviocytes have not been determined. These studies were designed to assess the hierarchy of upstream MEKKs, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, and transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase (TAK)1, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using either small interfering RNA ( siRNA) knockdown or knockout fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), MEKK1, MEKK2, or MEKK3 deficiency (either alone or in combination) had no effect on IL-1 beta-stimulated phospho-JNK (P-JNK) induction or MMP expression. However, TAK1 deficiency significantly decreased P-JNK, P-MKK4 and P-MKK7 induction compared with scrambled control. TAK1 knockdown did not affect p38 activation. Kinase assays showed that TAK1 siRNA significantly suppressed JNK kinase function. In addition, MKK4 and MKK7 kinase activity were significantly decreased in TAK1 deficient FLSs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a significant decrease in IL-1 beta induced AP-1 activation due to TAK1 knockdown. Quantitative PCR showed that TAK1 deficiency significantly decreased IL-1 beta-induced MMP3 gene expression and IL-6 protein expression. These results show that TAK1 is a critical pathway for IL-1 beta-induced activation of JNK and JNK-regulated gene expression in FLSs.

Evidence of limited recombination was demonstrated by the Sawyer's runs test, but the homoplasy test and site-by-site compatibility tests indicated frequent recombination events. Within the 1935 nucleotide gene, 292 sites were polymorphic with an average pair-wise difference of 5.01\%. Xia's distances for amino acids at non-synonymous codon substitution sites were smaller at homoplastic sites than at sites that were not homoplastic. Transitions were significantly more common among homoplastic than among non-homoplastic nucleotide substitutions. Simulations of evolution with or without recombination indicated the transition/transversion ratio is expected to be higher in homoplastic sites with no recombination. Despite evidence of recombination, analyses of the rnr genealogy does not show a random tree but rather base substitution behaviors characteristic of both recombination and substitution saturation at some sites. Analyses of sequences in the H. pylori multilocus sequence-typing database provided similar evidence for substitution saturation in multiple housekeeping genes.

The fungus is thermally dimorphic with two distinct forms corresponding to completely different lifestyles. Upon elevation of the temperature to that of the mammalian body, the fungus adopts a yeast-like form that is exclusively associated with its pathogenic lifestyle. We describe expressed sequence tags (ESTs) analysis to assess the expression profile of the mycelium to yeast transition. To identify P. brasiliensis differentially expressed sequences during conversion we performed a large-scale comparative analysis between P. brasiliensis ESTs identified in the transition transcriptome and databases. Results: Our analysis was based on 1107 ESTs from a transition cDNA library of P. brasiliensis. A total of 639 consensus sequences were assembled. Genes of primary metabolism, energy, protein synthesis and fate, cellular transport, biogenesis of cellular components were represented in the transition cDNA library. A considerable number of genes (7.51\%) had not been previously reported for P. brasiliensis in public databases. Gene expression analysis using in silico EST subtraction revealed that numerous genes were more expressed during the transition phase when compared to the mycelial ESTs [1]. Classes of differentially expressed sequences were selected for further analysis including: genes related to the synthesis/remodeling of the cell wall/membrane. Thirty four genes from this family were induced. Ten genes related to signal transduction were increased. Twelve genes encoding putative virulence factors manifested increased expression. The in silico approach was validated by northern blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Conclusion: The developmental program of P. brasiliensis is characterized by significant differential positive modulation of the cell wall/membrane related transcripts, and signal transduction proteins, suggesting the related processes important contributors to dimorphism. Also, putative virulence factors are more expressed in the transition process suggesting adaptation to the host of the yeast incoming parasitic phase. Those genes provide ideal candidates for further studies directed at understanding fungal morphogenesis and its regulation.","Univ Fed Goias, Mol Biol Lab, Inst Ciencias Biol, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; Univ Fed Goias, Dept Bioquim \& Biol Mol, Goiania, Go, Brazil; Univ Brasilia, Mol Biol Lab, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Catolica Goias, Dept Informat, Goiania, Go, Brazil; LO","; data\_id:GSE3238; data\_collection\_article:Nunes LR, Costa de Oliveira R, Leite DB, da Silva VS et al.

Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine the expression change of growth factors, especially amphiregulin, in human mast cells induced by IgE cross-linking. Methods: Microarray analysis and RT-PCR were used to analyze the gene expression profile of human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) stimulated with IgE cross-linking. Protein secretion in the supernatants of CBMCs was measured by means of ELISA. Double-immunofluorescence staining was used to analyze the expression in the lung mast cells. Results: Of the 64 different growth factor genes analyzed, 5 were found to be substantially upregulated. Among them, amphiregulin mRNA was induced by 44-fold in CBMCs on activation through IgE cross-linking. Secretion of amphiregulin protein was evident in CBMCs 8 hours after stimulation. Amphiregulin was also expressed in human lung mast cells from patients with asthma, as demonstrated by means of double-immunofluorescence staining. Amphiregulin promoted the proliferation of the primary human lung fibroblasts, and amphiregulin-treated primary human lung fibroblasts showed a marked increase in the expression of c-fos, a proto-oncogene that facilitates or is required for the proliferation of a wide variety of cells. Conclusion: Human CBMCs secreted amphiregulin on IgE cross-linking, and the amphiregulin induced proliferation of primary human lung fibroblasts.

First published February 27, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajplung.90607.2008.-IL-17F is involved in asthma, but its biological function and signaling pathway have not been fully elucidated. IL-11 is clearly expressed in the airway of patients with allergic airway diseases such as asthma and plays an important role in airway remodeling and inflammation. Therefore, we investigated the expression of IL-11 by IL-17F in bronchial epithelial cells. Bronchial epithelial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-17F and/or Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) or various kinase inhibitors to analyze the expression of IL-11. Next, activation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) 1 by IL-17F was investigated. Moreover, the effect of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting MSK1 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) on IL-17F-induced IL-11 expression was investigated. IL-17F induced IL-11 expression, whereas the costimulation with IL-4 and IL-13 augmented this effect even further. MEK inhibitors PD-98059, U0126, and Raf1 kinase inhibitor I, significantly inhibited IL-11 production, whereas overexpression of a Raf1 dominant-negative mutant inhibited its expression. IL-17F clearly phosphorylated MSK1, whereas PD-98059 inhibited the phosphorylation of IL-17F-induced MSK1. Both MSK1 inhibitors Ro-31-8220 and H89 significantly blocked IL-11 expression. Moreover, transfection of the cells with siRNAs targeting MSK1 inhibited activation of CREB, and the siRNAs targeting MSK1 and CREB blocked expression of IL-11. These data suggest that IL-17F may be involved in airway inflammation and remodeling via the induction of IL-11, and RafI-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-MSK1-CREB is identified as a novel signaling pathway participating in this process. Therefore, the IL-17F/IL-11 axis may be a valuable therapeutic target for asthma.","[Kawaguchi, Mio; Fujita, Junichi; Hizawa, Nobuyuki] Univ Tsukuba, Inst Clin Med, Dept Resp Med, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan; [Kokubu, Fumio] Showa Univ, Fujigaoka Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227, Japan; [Huang, Shau-Ku] Johns Hopkins Univ,","; data\_id:GSE3271; data\_collection\_article:Sayama K, Diehn M, Matsuda K, Lunderius C et al.

Nine genes were significantly deregulated in MMs compared with normal controls.

Chk1 is a principal mediator of cell-cycle checkpoints in response to genotoxic stress. We confirmed the overexpression of Chk1 in an independent set of 87 MMs by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. To determine whether Chk1 down-regulation would affect cell-cycle control and cell survival, we transfected either control or Chk1 siRNA into two mesothelioma cell lines and a nontumorigenic (Met5a) cell line. Results showed that Chk1 knockdown increased the apoptotic fraction of MM cells and induced an S phase block in Met5a cells. Furthermore, Chk1 silencing sensitized P53-null MM cells to both an S phase block and apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin. Our results indicate that cell-cycle gene expression analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction can identify potential targets for novel therapies. Chk1 knockdown could provide a novel therapeutic approach to arrest cell-cycle progression in MM cells, thus increasing the rate of cell death.

We previously characterized AtATM, an Arabidopsis homolog of the human ATM gene, which is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, a chromosome instability disorder. The Atm protein is a protein kinase whose activity is induced by DNA damage, particularly DNA double-strand breaks. The phosphorylation targets of Atm include proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Here, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of two Arabidopsis mutants carrying a T-DNA insertion in AtATM. Arabidopsis atm mutants are hypersensitive to gamma-radiation and methylmethane sulfonate but not to UV-B light. In correlation with the radiation sensitivity, atm mutants failed to induce the transcription of genes involved in the repair and/or detection of DNA breaks upon irradiation. In addition, atm mutants are partially sterile, and we show that this effect is attributable to abundant chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis. Interestingly, the transcription of DNA recombination genes during meiosis was not dependent on AtATM, and meiotic recombination occurred at the same rate as in wild-type plants, raising questions about the function of AtAtm during meiosis in plants. Our results demonstrate that AtATM plays a central role in the response to both stress-induced and developmentally programmed DNA damage.","CEA, Dept Ecophysiol Vegetale \& Microbiol, Lab Radiobiol Vegetale, F-13108 St Paul Les Durance, France; INRA, Biol Cellulaire Lab, F-78026 Versailles, France; ROCKVILLE; 15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA","; data\_id:GSE3358; data\_collection\_article:Gasch AP, Huang M, Metzner S, Botstein D et al.

Recent studies have demonstrated enrichment for sequences with intramolecular G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP) in transcriptional promoters of humans, chickens and bacteria. Here we survey the yeast genome for QFP sequences and similarly find strong enrichment for these sequences in upstream promoter regions, as well as weaker but significant enrichment in open reading frames (ORFs). Further, four findings are consistent with roles for QFP sequences in transcriptional regulation. First, QFP is correlated with upstream promoter regions with low histone occupancy. Second, treatment of cells with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), which binds G-quadruplexes selectively in vitro, causes significant upregulation of loci with QFP-possessing promoters or ORFs. NMM also causes downregulation of loci connected with the function of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which itself has high QFP. Third, ORFs with QFP are selectively downregulated in sgs1 mutants that lack the G4-DNA-unwinding helicase Sgs1p. Fourth, a screen for yeast mutants that enhance or suppress growth inhibition by NMM revealed enrichment for chromatin and transcriptional regulators, as well as telomere maintenance factors. These findings raise the possibility that QFP sequences form bona fide G-quadruplexes in vivo and thus regulate transcription.","[Chen, Qijun; Lee, Julia Y.; Kozak, Marina L.; Wang, Li-San; Johnson, F.

So far, Hsp26 was the only unambiguously identified member of the sHsp family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show here that the sHsp system in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae consists of two proteins, Hsp26 and Hsp42. Hsp42 forms large dynamic oligomers with a barrel-like structure. In contrast to Hsp26, which functions predominantly at heat shock temperatures, Hsp42 is active as a chaperone under all conditions tested in vivo and in vitro. Under heat shock conditions, both Hsp42 and Hsp26 suppress the aggregation of one-third of the cytosolic proteins. This subset is about 90\% overlapping for Hsp42 and Hsp26. The sHsp substrates belong to different biochemical pathways. This indicates a general protective function of sHsps for proteome stability in S. cerevisiae. Consistent with this observation, sHsp knockout strains show phenotypical defects. Taken together, our results define Hsp42 as an important player for protein homeostasis at physiological and under stress conditions.","Tech Univ Munich, Inst Organ Chem \& Biochem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; Tech Univ Munich, Abt Elektronenmikroskopie, D-8046 Garching, Germany; NEW YORK; 345 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1707 USA","; data\_id:GSE3358; data\_collection\_article:Gasch AP, Huang M, Metzner S, Botstein D et al.

Here we show that cells lacking Hst3p) and Hst4p, in which H3 K56 is constitutively, hyperacetylated, exhibit hallmarks of spontaneous DNA damage, such is activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53p and upregulation of DNA-damage inducible genes. Consistently, hst3 hst4 cells display synthetic lethality interactions with mutations that cripple genes involved in DNA replication and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. In most cases, synthetic lethality depends upon hyperacetylation of H3 K56 because it can he suppressed by mutation of K56 to arginine, which mimics the nonacetylated state. We also show that hst3 hst4 phenotypes can he suppressed by overexpression of the PCNA clamp loader large subunit, Rfclp, and by inactivation of, the alternative-clamp loaders CTF18, RAD24, and ELGI. Loss of, CTF4, encoding a replisome component involved in sister chromatid cohesion, also suppresses hst3 hst4 phenotypes. Genetic analysis suggests that CTF4 is a part of the K56 acetylation pathway that converges on and modulates replisomes function. This pahtway represents an important mechanism for maintenance of genomic stability mid depends upon proper regulation of H3 K56 acetylation by Hst3p and Hst4p. Our data also suggest the existence of a precarious balance between Rfclp and the other RFC complexes and that the nonreplicative forms of RFC are strongly deleterious to cells that have genomewide and constitutive H3 K56 hyperacetylation.","[Celic, Ivana; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, High Throughput Biol Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Celic, Ivana; Boeke, Jef D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Biol \& Genet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Verreault, Alain] Univ Montreal, Dept","; data\_id:GSE3358; data\_collection\_article:Gasch AP, Huang M, Metzner S, Botstein D et al.

We discovered a novel role for the Snf1 kinase in the cellular response to genotoxic stress in yeast. snf1 mutants are hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (HU), methyl-methane sulfonate, and cadmium, but they are not sensitive to several other genotoxic agents. HU inhibits ribunucleotide reductase (RNR), and deletion of SNF1 also increased the growth defects of an rnr4 ribonucleotide reductase mutant. The snf1 mutant has a functional checkpoint response to HU insofar as cells arrest division normally and derepress the transcription of RNR genes. The sensitivity of snf1 to HU or to RNR4 deletion may be due to posttranscriptional defects in RNR function or to defects in the repair of, and recovery from, stalled replication forks. The Mig3 repressor was identified as one target of Snf1 in this pathway. Genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that a weak kinase activity is sufficient to confer resistance to HU, whereas a high level of kinase activity is required for optimal growth on carbon sources other than glucose. Quantitative regulation of Snf1 kinase activity may contribute to the specificity of the effector responses that it controls.","CEA Saclay, Serv Biochim \& Genet Mol, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; WASHINGTON; 1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA","; data\_id:GSE3358; data\_collection\_article:Gasch AP, Huang M, Metzner S, Botstein D et al.

Experimental Design: cDNA microarray analysis was used to detect differences in gene expression between normal tissue and colon tumors and polyps isolated from 20 patients. To identify genes that are important in regulating the growth properties of colorectal cancer, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt expression of several of the overexpressed genes in a colon tumor cell line, HCT116, which showed similar patterns of gene expression as many of the patient tumors. Results: Expression changes of greater than or equal to2-fold in approximately one-third of the patients were consistently observed for 2632 of a total of 9592 genes (574 up-regulated genes and 2058 down-regulated genes). Subsequent analysis of 13 genes by quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the reliability of this analysis. RNAi-mediated disruption of the expression of one of these genes, survivin, a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, severely reduced tumor growth both in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. Conclusions: The combined use of microarray analysis and RNAi provides an excellent system to define the role of specific genes that are up-regulated in cancer lead to the increased in vitro and in vivo growth of colon tumors.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Simmons Canc Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; BIRMINGHAM; PO BOX","; data\_id:GSE3398; data\_collection\_article:Garber ME, Troyanskaya OG, Schluens K, Petersen S et al.

We performed conventional cytogenetics and immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratins (CKs) on 126 ccRCCs. Protein expression was evaluated in situ using a semiautomated quantitative system. The results were validated using an independent cohort of 209 ccRCCs with long-term follow-up. Cytogenetic alterations were identified in 96 of 126 ccRCCs, most of them involving chromosome 3 through loss, deletion or translocation. Expression of CKs and E-cadherin in ccRCC was associated with lack of cytogenetic alterations and low nuclear grade. In the validation set, CK7 and CK19 protein expression was associated with better clinical outcome. At the multivariate level, the best model included metastatic status and CK19 expression. Expression microarray analysis on 21 primary ccRCCs and 14 ccRCC metastases identified genes significantly associated with CK7 and CK19 expressing ccRCCs. Two novel ccRCC biomarkers associated with the CK7 positive ccRCC phenotype, PMS2 and MT1-MMP (MMP14), were further validated. We conclude that the variability observed for CK expression in ccRCC can be explained by genetic heterogeneity. Distinct molecular subtypes of ccRCC with prognostic relevance were identified, and the CK7/CK19 expressing subtype is associated with better outcome.

Among them, most up-regulated genes, such as AQP3 and Claudin-4, were expressed in both adenocarcinoma cells and type II alveolar pneumocytes, corresponding to the histological similarity between these cell types.

We conclude that MRP3 could be a novel molecular marker for LNMBAC, whose expression increases during the early progression of tumourigenesis.

Aberrant functioning of the stroma was found to support tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Among many crucial aspects of breast cancer biology two issues focused our attention; (I) the impact of mutual interactions between the cancer cells and the stroma, specifically the endothelial cells and (II) the impact of insulin like growth factor one (IGF-I) on the gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts, as an example of the influence of a growth factor on the stroma. To address tumor-endothelial interaction we took advantage of an in vitro system mimicking the interaction of tumor and endothelial cells and explored gene expression changes using DNA microarrays. Our results suggest the interaction of endothelial cells and tumor cells that express the CD44+/CD24- signature indicative of stem cell-like cells, which are thought to have a low proliferative potential, might explain the unexpected and paradoxical association of the CD44+/CD24- signature with highly proliferative tumors that have an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, the gene expression signature induced in this system is of prognostic value in early stage and metastatic breast cancer. Since malignant epithelial cells and tumor-associated stromal cells are under the influence of hormones and growth factors, we examined the effects of IGF-I on cancer cells and primary fibroblasts in parallel to assess concordant and discordant gene expression changes. Our results show that primary breast fibroblasts, breast carcinoma associated fibroblasts and primary lung fibroblasts respond to IGF-I stimulation with increased expression of genes related with proliferation, which is phenotypically followed by an increased growth rate. Comparing in vitro gene expression data with available in vivo data, we have shown that the evoked gene expression signatures are able to stratify patients into groups with significantly different outcome. We propose that this prognostic gene expression signature might also serve as a predictor for the effectiveness of an anti-IGF-I therapy, a new therapeutic strategy that is currently in phase III development. Concluding, the data presented in this thesis underline the importance of the stroma, specifically the interaction between tumor and endothelial cells and the response of the stroma to stimulation with growth factors such as IGF-I. The gene expression changes in response to these interactions and stimulations carry prognostic information and might potentially be useful in clinical decision making.",,"Garber ME, Troyanskaya OG, Schluens K, Petersen S et al.

To investigate the involvement of H2AvD, a Drosophila homologue of mammalian H2A.Z, in mechanisms of conditional activation of facultatively silenced genes, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing H2AvD fused at the C- or N-terminus with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using heat shock-induced gene activation and polytene chromosome puff formation as an in vivo model system, we analyzed effects of H2AvD termini modifications on transcription. We found that N-terminally fused GFP inhibited H2AvD acetylation and impaired heat shock-induced puff formation and hsp70 gene activation.

It is currently unknown which genes are regulated by physiological TH levels. Objective: We examined the effects of L-thyroxine on human skeletal muscle transcriptome. Design: Microarray analysis of transcript levels was performed using skeletal muscle biopsies from patients under euthyroid and hypothyroid conditions. Setting: The study was conducted in a university hospital laboratory. Patients: We studied skeletal muscle obtained from 10 thyroidectomized patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma on and after 4 wk off L-thyroxine replacement. Mean Outcome Measures: Gene expression changes were measured using microarrays. Results were analyzed using dedicated statistical methods. Results: We detected 607 differentially expressed genes on L-thyroxine treatment, of which approximately 60\% were positively and approximately 40\% were negatively regulated. Representative genes were validated by quantitative PCR. Genes involved in energy and fuel metabolism were overrepresented among the up-regulated genes, of which a large number were newly associated with thyroid state. L-thyroxine therapy induced a large down-regulation of the primary transcripts of the noncoding microRNA pair miR-206/miR-133b. Conclusion: We demonstrated that physiological levels of TH regulate a myriad of genes in human skeletal muscle. The identification of novel putatively TH-responsive genes may provide the molecular basis of clinical effects in subjects with different TH status. The observation that TH regulates microRNAs reveals a new layer of complexity by which TH influences cellular processes. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94: 3487-3496, 2009)","[Visser, W.

While the Hox transcriptional regulators have to be viewed as excellent candidates for assuming such a role, little is known about their presumptive cardiovascular control functions and in vivo expression patterns. Results: We demonstrate that conventional reporter gene analysis in transgenic mice is a useful approach for defining highly complex Hox expression patterns in the adult vascular network as exemplified by our lacZ reporter gene models for Hoxa3 and Hoxc11. These mice revealed expression in subsets of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) located in distinct regions of the vasculature that roughly correspond to the embryonic expression domains of the two genes. These reporter gene patterns were validated as authentic indicators of endogenous gene expression by immunolabeling and PCR analysis. Furthermore, we show that persistent reporter gene expression in cultured cells derived from vessel explants facilitates in vitro characterization of phenotypic properties as exemplified by the differential response of Hoxc11-lacZ-positive versus-negative cells in migration assays and to serum. Conclusion: The data support a conceptual model of Hox-specified positional identities in adult blood vessels, which is of likely relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying regional physiological diversities in the cardiovascular system. The data also demonstrate that conventional Hox reporter gene mice are useful tools for visualizing complex Hox expression patterns in the vascular network that might be unattainable otherwise. Finally, these mice are a resource for the isolation and phenotypic characterization of specific subpopulations of vascular cells marked by distinct Hox expression profiles.","[Pruett, Nathanael D.; Jacobs, Donna F.; Scholz, Dimitri; Awgulewitsch, Alexander] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Med, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Visconti, Richard P.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Anat \& Cell Biol, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [McQuinn, Tim] Med Uni","; data\_id:GSE3551; data\_collection\_article:Chang HY, Chi JT, Dudoit S, Bondre C et al.

In this work we propose an improved phylogenetic profile analysis on 14 Vibrionaceae genomes, to study the evolution of this family on the basis of gene content. The phylogenetic profile is based on the observation that genes involved in the same process (e.g. metabolic pathway or structural complex) tend to be concurrently present or absent within different genomes. This allows the prediction of hypothetical functions on the basis of a shared phylogenetic profiles. Moreover this approach is useful to identify putative laterally transferred elements on the basis of their presence on distantly phylogenetically related bacteria. Results: Vibrionaceae ORFs were aligned against all the available bacterial proteomes. Phylogenetic profile is defined as an array of distances, based on aminoacid substitution matrixes, from single genes to all their orthologues. Final phylogenetic profiles, derived from non-redundant list of all ORFs, was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster. The resulting phylogenetic profiles matrix contains gene clusters on the rows and organisms on the columns. Cluster analysis identified groups of ""core genes"" with a widespread high similarity across all the organisms and several clusters that contain genes homologous only to a limited set of organisms. On each of these clusters, COG class enrichment has been calculated. The analysis reveals that clusters of core genes have the highest number of enriched classes, while the others are enriched just for few of them like DNA replication, recombination and repair. Conclusion: We found that mobile elements have heterogeneous profiles not only across the entire set of organisms, but also within Vibrionaceae; this confirms their great influence on bacteria evolution even inside the same family. Furthermore, several hypothetical proteins highly correlate with mobile elements profiles suggesting a possible horizontal transfer mechanism for the evolution of these genes. Finally, we suggested the putative role of some ORFs having an unknown function on the basis of their phylogenetic profile similarity to well characterized genes.","Univ Padua, CRIBI Biotechnol Ctr, Dept Biol, I-35100 Padua, Italy; LONDON; MIDDLESEX HOUSE, 34-42 CLEVELAND ST, LONDON W1T 4LB, ENGLAND","; data\_id:GSE3564; data\_collection\_article:Chan K, Baker S, Kim CC, Detweiler CS et al.

Typhimurium) causes a severe and lethal systemic disease in mice, characterized by poor activation of the adaptive immune response against Salmonella-derived antigens. Recently, we and others have reported that this feature relies on the ability of S. Typhimurium to survive within murine dendritic cells (DCs) and avoid the presentation of bacteria-derived antigens to T cells. In contrast, here we show that infection of murine DCs with either S. Typhi or S. Enteritidis, two serovars adapted to different hosts, leads to an efficient T-cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, S. Typhi and S. Enteritidis failed to replicate within murine DCs and were quickly degraded, allowing T-cell activation. In contrast, human DCs were found to be permissive for survival and proliferation of S. Typhi, but not for S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis. Our data suggest that Salmonella host restriction is characterized by the ability of these bacteria to survive within DCs and avoid activation of the adaptive immune response in their specific hosts.","[Bueno, Susan M.; Gonzalez, Pablo A.; Carreno, Leandro J.; Tobar, Jaime A.; Kalergis, Alexis M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Mol Genet \& Microbiol, Santiago, Chile; [Mora, Guido C.] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile; [Pereda,","; data\_id:GSE3564; data\_collection\_article:Chan K, Baker S, Kim CC, Detweiler CS et al.

Typhi CT18, and ultimately compare these integrated bacteriophages against 40 other Salmonella isolates using DNA microarray technology. S. Typhi CT18 contains prophages that show similarity to the lambda, Mu, P2 and P4 bacteriophage families. When compared to other S. Typhi isolates, these elements were generally conserved, supporting a clonal origin of this serovar. However, distinct variation was detected within a broad range of Salmonella serovars; many of the prophage regions are predicted to be specific to S. Typhi. Some of the P2 family prophage analysed have the potential to carry non-essential ""cargo"" genes within the hyper-variable tail region, an observation that suggests that these bacteriophage may confer a level of specialisation on their host. Lysogenic bacteriophages therefore play a crucial role in the generation of genetic diversity within S. enterica. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Proteome profiling is a valuable tool that may reveal uncharacteristic cell phenotypes in transformed cells. Changes in expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and other proteins interacting with glutathione (GSH) in model cell lines could be of particular interest. Methods: We compared the phenotypes of breast cell lines EM-G3, HCC1937, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 using 2-D electrophoresis (2-DE). We further separated GSH-binding proteins from the cell lines using affinity chromatography with GSH-Sepharose 4B, performed 2-DE analysis and identified the main protein spots. Results: Correlation coefficients among 2-DE gels from the cell lines were lower than 0.65, pointing to dissimilarity among the cell lines. Differences in primary constituents of the cytoskeleton were shown by the 2-D protein maps and western blots. The spot patterns in gels of GSH-binding fractions from primary carcinoma-derived cell lines HCC1937 and EM-G3 were similar to each other, and they differed from the spot patterns of cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 that were derived from pleural effusions of metastatic mammary carcinoma patients. Major differences in the expression of GST P1-1 and carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1 were observed among the cell lines, indicating differential abilities of the cell lines to metabolize xenobiotics. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the applicability of targeted affinity chromatography to proteome profiling and allowed us to characterize the phenotypes of four breast cancer cell lines.","[Mladkova, Jana; Sanda, Miloslav; Selicharova, Irena] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Organ Chem \& Biochem, VVI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Matouskova, Eva] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Biochem \& Expt Oncol, Fac Med 1, Prague, Czech Republic; [Matouskova, Eva] C","; data\_id:GSE3570; data\_collection\_article:Brozova M, Kleibl Z, Netikova I, Sevcik J et al.

Identification of proteins resembling the tumor biology can improve the diagnosis, prediction, treatment selection, and targeting of therapy. Since the beginning of the post-genomic era, the focus of molecular biology gradually moved from genomes to proteins and proteomes and to their functionality. Proteomics can potentially capture dynamic changes in protein expression integrating both genetic and epigenetic influences. Methods: We prepared primary cultures of epithelial cells from 23 breast cancer tissue samples and performed comparative proteomic analysis. Seven patients developed distant metastases within three-year follow-up. These samples were included into a metastase-positive group, the others formed a metastase-negative group. Two-dimensional electrophoretical (2-DE) gels in pH range 4-7 were prepared. Spot densities in 2-DE protein maps were subjected to statistical analyses (R/maanova package) and data-mining analysis (GUHA). For identification of proteins in selected spots, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed. Results: Three protein spots were significantly altered between the metastatic and non-metastatic groups. The correlations were proven at the 0.05 significance level. Nucleophosmin was increased in the group with metastases. The levels of 2,3-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase and glutathione peroxidase 1 were decreased.

This neural network is a key site for interactions between brain reward and stress systems, and has been implicated in several aspects of drug abuse. In order to increase our understanding of EAc function at the molecular level, we undertook a genome-wide screen (Affymetrix) to identify genes whose expression is enriched in the mouse EAc. We focused on the less-well known BNST-CeA areas of the EAc, and identified 121 genes that exhibit more than twofold higher expression level in the EAc compared with whole brain. Among these, 43 genes have never been described to be expressed in the EAc. We mapped these genes throughout the brain, using non-radioactive in situ hybridization, and identified eight genes with a unique and distinct rostro-caudal expression pattern along AcbSh, BNST and CeA. Q-PCR analysis performed in brain and peripheral organ tissues indicated that, with the exception of one (Spata13), all these genes are predominantly expressed in brain. These genes encode signaling proteins (Adora2, GPR88, Arpp21 and Rem2), a transcription factor (Limh6) or proteins of unknown function (Rik130, Spata13 and Wfs1). The identification of genes with enriched expression expands our knowledge of EAc at a molecular level, and provides useful information to toward genetic manipulations within the EAc. (C) 2008 IBRO.

Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was used to demonstrate changes in transcription levels of two putative P-glycoprotein genes, designated here as SL0525 and SL-Pgp1, in sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) following exposure to emamectin benzoate (EMB). Pre-adult L. salmonis were challenged in an EMB bioassay for 24 h and gene expression was studied from lice surviving EMB concentrations of 0, 10, and 30 ppb. Gene expression was measured using Q-RT-PCR with elongation factor 1 (eEF1 alpha) as an internal reference gene. The results show that both target genes, SL0525 and SL-Pgp1, had significantly increased levels of expression with exposure to 10 ppb EMB (p = 0. 11 and p = 0. 17, respectively) whereas the group exposed to 30 ppb was on the verge of being significant (p = 0.053) only in the expression of SL-Pgp1. Gene expression for SL0525 and SL-Pgp1 were increased over five-fold at 10 ppb EMB. Therefore, the upregulation of these target genes may offer protection by increasing P-p expression when lice are exposed to EMB. Our optimized Q-RT-PCR can be used to determine if over-expression of these genes could be the basis for development of resistance in sea lice and thus allow suitable alternative chemotherapeutic options to be assessed.

We have evaluated the effect of FTY720 on atherogenesis and lipid metabolism. Methods and Results-ApoE(-/-) mice on a normal laboratory diet received oral FTY720 for 12 weeks, which led to a 2.4-fold increase in serum cholesterol ( largely VLDL fraction) and a 1.8-fold increase in hepatic HMGCoA reductase mRNA. FTY720 increased plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate and induced marked peripheral blood lymphopenia. A discoordinate modulation of B, T and monocyte cell numbers was found in peripheral lymphoid organs. Overall depletion of T cells was accompanied by a relative ( 2-fold) increase in regulatory T cell content paralleled by a similar increase in effector memory T cells ( CD4+CD44hiCD62lo) as absolute numbers of both subpopulations remained essentially unchanged. Lymphocyte function was unaltered as indicated by anti-OxLDL antibodies and T cell proliferation. There were no changes in atherosclerotic lesions in early and established atherosclerosis. Conclusions-FTY720 mediated peripheral lymphocyte depletion and retrafficking without altering function and overall balance of pro- and antiatherogenic lymphocyte populations.

Results Mice fed MCD formulas developed similar degrees of hepatic steatosis whether they contained glucose or fructose. By contrast, mice fed MCD-fructose developed significantly more hepatocellular injury than mice fed MCD-glucose, judged by histology, apoptosis staining and serum alanine aminotransferase. Liver injury in MCD-fructose mice coincided with an exaggerated rise in the ratio of long-chain saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the liver. Notably, hepatic inflammation was not enhanced in mice fed MCD-fructose, correlating instead with hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was equivalent in the two MCD groups. Discussion Fructose is more cytotoxic than glucose when used as the source of carbohydrate in MCD formulas. Conclusion The data suggest the enhanced cytotoxicity of fructose in the MCD model is related to its ability to stimulate de novo lipogenesis, which yields harmful long-chain saturated fatty acids.","[Pickens, Michael K.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Pickens, Michael K.; Ogata, Hisanobu; Soon, Russell K.; Grenert, James P.; Maher, Jacquelyn J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Liver, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [O","; data\_id:GSE3889; data\_collection\_article:Flowers MT, Groen AK, Oler AT, Keller MP et al.

Custom Vitis bud cDNA microarrays (9,216 features) were used to examine gene expression patterns in overwintering Vitis riparia buds during 2,000 h of 4A degrees C chilling. Three-node cuttings collected concurrently with buds were monitored to determine dormancy status. Chilling requirement was fulfilled after 1,500 h of chilling; however, 2,000 h of chilling significantly increased the rate of bud break. Microarray analysis identified 1,469 significantly differentially expressed (p value < 0.05) array features when 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 h of chilling were compared to 500 h of chilling. Functional classification revealed that the majority of genes were involved in metabolism, cell defense/stress response, and genetic information processing. The number of significantly differentially expressed genes increased with chilling hour accumulation. The expression of a group of 130 genes constantly decreased during the chilling period. Up-regulated genes were not detected until the later stages of chilling accumulation. Hierarchical clustering of non-redundant expressed sequence tags revealed inhibition of genes involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism and activation of genes involved in signaling and cell growth. Clusters with expression patterns associated with increased chilling and bud break were identified, indicating several candidate genes that may serve as indicators of bud chilling requirement fulfillment.","[Mathiason, Kathy; He, Dong; Grimplet, Jerome; Fennell, Anne] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Hort Forestry Landscape \& Pk, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; Univ Arizona, Bio5 Inst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Or, Etti] Ag","; data\_id:GSE3913; data\_collection\_article:Horvath DP, Soto-Su\'{a}rez M, Anderson JV, Chao WS.

The MUC1 heterodimeric oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in prostate cancers; however, it is not known if MUC1 is of functional importance to these tumors. To assess dependence on MUC1, we synthesized an inhibitor, designated GO-201, which interacts directly with the MUC1-C subunit at its oligomerization domain. Treatment of MUC1-positive DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells with GO-201, and not an altered version, resulted in inhibition of proliferation. GO-201 also induced necrotic cell death that was associated with increases in reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and depletion of ATP. By contrast, GO-201 had no effect against MUC1-negative LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, and MDA-PCa-2b prostate cancer cells. Significantly, GO-201 treatment of DU145 and PC3 xenografts growing in nude mice resulted in complete tumor regression and prolonged lack of recurrence. These findings indicate that certain prostate cancer cells are dependent on MUC1-C for growth and survival and that directly targeting MUC1-C results in their death in vitro and in tumor models.

Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC), found in selenium-enriched alliums, is one of the most potent forms. We exposed two human prostate cell lines (LNCaP clone FGC and PNT1A) to nutritionally relevant doses of MSC and selenite, ranging from deficient to the equivalent of selenium supplementation in humans. The cells were adapted for one month to attain steady-state selenium status. Two microarray platforms, an in-house printed microarray (14,000 genes) and the Affymetrix U133A array (22,000 genes) were used to probe the molecular effects of selenium dose and form and several selenium-responsive genes were identified, many of which have been ascribed to cancer cell growth and progression. In response to MSC supplementation, the expression of 23 genes changed significantly, including several collagen genes. Quantitative RT-PCR assays were designed and optimized for four of the collagen genes to validate array data. Significant decreases in expression of collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), COL1A2 and COL7A1 genes were observed in cells adapted to MSC supplementation compared to the control and selenite exposed cells. There were significant increases in genes encoding other types of collagen, including significant increases in COL6A1 and COL4A5 in response to MSC dose. Functional changes in collagen type I protein expression in response to MSC were confirmed by ELISA. This study reveals for the first time that MSC can alter the expression of several types of collagen and thus potentially modulate the extracellular matrix and stroma, which may at least partially explain the anti-cancer activity of MSC.

Also, 57 fresh frozen endometrial carcinomas were studied for the relationship between BMI-1 protein expression, BMI-1 mRNA level, and activation of an 11-gene signature reported to represent a BMI-1-driven pathway. BMI-1 protein expression was significantly weaker in tumours with vascular invasion (P < 0.0001), deep myometrial infiltration (P = 0.004), and loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) (P < 0.0001) and progesterone receptors (PR) (P = 0.03). Low BMI-1 protein expression was highly associated with low BMI-1 mRNA expression (P = 0.002), and similarly low BMI-1 mRNA expression correlated significantly with vascular invasion, ER and PR loss, and histologic grade 3. In contrast, activation of the reported 11-gene signature, supposed to represent a BMI-1-driven pathway, correlated with low mRNA expression of BMI-1 (P < 0.001), hormone receptor loss, presence of vascular invasion, and poor prognosis. We conclude that BMI-1 protein and mRNA expression are significantly correlated and that BMI-1 expression is inversely associated with activation of the 11-gene signature. Loss of BMI-1 seems to be associated with an aggressive phenotype in endometrial carcinomas.","[Engelsen, I. B.; Salvesen, H.

Blocking the heparin-binding site of cleaved or latent antithrombin by complexation with a high-affinity heparin pentasaccharide abolished the serpin's ability to inhibit proliferation, migration, capillary-like tube formation, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) signaling, and perlecan gene expression in bFGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mutation of key heparin binding residues, when combined with modifications of Asn-linked carbohydrate chains near the heparin-binding site, also could abrogate the antiproliferative activity of the cleaved serpin. Surprisingly, mutation of Lys114, which blocks anticoagulant activation of antithrombin by heparin, caused the native protein to acquire anti proliferative activity without the need for conformational change. Together, these results indicate that the heparin-binding site of antithrombin is of crucial importance for mediating the serpin's antiangiogenic activity and that heparin activation of native antithrombin constitutes an antiangiogenic switch that is responsible for turning off the antiangiogenic activity of the native serpin.","Univ Illinois, Ctr Mol Biol Oral Dis, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Biochem \& Mol Genet, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; WASHINGTON; 1900 M STREET.

We mapped morphological specializations of the digging apparatus onto our phylogenetic hypothesis and attempted to match morphological diversity with information on the ecology and behaviour of octodontoid taxa. Burrowing for sheltering and rearing is the rule among octodontids and ctenomyids, and adaptations for digging have been known from the Early Pliocene onward. However, only a few taxa have evolved fully subterranean habits. Scratch-digging is widespread among both semifossorial and fully subterranean lineages, and morphological changes associated with scratch-digging are not restricted to subterranean lineages. By contrast, various adaptations for chisel-tooth digging are restricted to some subterranean lineages and are combined differently in the octodontid Spalacopus, the fossil ctenomyid Eucelophorus, and some living Ctenomys. Some octodontid taxa are able to dig complex burrows in spite of having no substantial changes in musculoskeletal attributes. Hence, we suggest that, during the early evolution of those branches giving rise to fully subterranean ctenomyids and octodontids, a change in behaviour probably preceded the origin of structural adaptations.

Like all North American white pines (subsect. Strobus), sugar pine is highly susceptible to white pine blister rust, a disease caused by the fungus Cronartium ribicola. We conducted a chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) survey of Pinus subsect. Strobus with comprehensive geographical sampling of P. lambertiana. Sequence analysis of 12 sugar pine individuals revealed strong geographical differentiation for two chloroplast haplotypes. A diagnostic restriction site survey of an additional 72 individuals demarcated a narrow 150-km contact zone in northeastern California. In the contact zone, maternal (megagametophtye) and paternal (embryo) haplotypes were identified in 31 single seeds, demonstrating bidirectional pollen flow extending beyond the range of maternal haplotypes. The frequencies of the Cr1 allele for white pine blister rust major gene resistance, previously determined for 41 seed zones, differ significantly among seed zones that are fixed for the alternate haplotypes, or contain a mixture of both haplotypes. Interspecific phylogenetic analysis reveals that the northern sugar pine haplotype belongs to a clade that includes Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine) and all of the East Asian white pines. Furthermore, there is little cpDNA divergence between northern sugar pine and whitebark pine (dS = 0.00058).

(Sapindaceae) were studied under scanning electron microscope and light microscope to determine its systematic position within Sapindaceae. Flowers arise in terminal thyrses. The sepal primordia initiate in a spiral (2/5) sequence, which are not synchronous. The five petal primordia initiate almost synchronously and alternate with sepal primordia. Eight stamens initiate almost simultaneously and their differentiation precedes that of the petals. The last formed petal and one stamen initiate from a common primordium. Mature stamens curve inwards and cover the ovary in bud. The gynoecium begins as a hemispheric primordium on which two carpellary lobes arise simultaneously. Later in development a single gynocium is formed with two locules and two ovules per locule. Floral morphology suggests a closer affinity with Sapindaceae, although certain features of floral ontogenesis are similar to those observed in certain members of the former Hippocastanaceae, such as Handeliodendron.","[Cao, Li-Min; Xia, Nian-He] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Econ Bot, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Cao, Li-Min] Hengyang Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, Hengyang 421008, Peoples R China; [Cao, Li-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100","; data\_id:S1212; data\_collection\_article:Harrington M., Edwards K., Johnson S., Chase M., \& Gadek P. 2005.

Originally G. fragariae was considered a saprophyte occurring on dead tissues of strawberry plants. Recently this fungus was found in Latvia and Sweden, and it was proven to be the cause of severe root rot and petiole blight of strawberry. Thirteen isolates of this pathogen and several other Gnomonia species occurring on rosaceous hosts were characterized by molecular analysis using nucleotide sequences of partial LSU rRNA gene and the total ITS region. The homologous regions from relevant diaporthalean taxa available in the GenBank were also included and compared with the taxa sequenced in this study. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that G. fragariae, G. rubi, and Gnomonia sp. (CBS 850.79) were genetically different from G. gnomon, the type species of the genus, and other members of Gnomoniaceae. The analyses showed that G. fragariae and Hapalocystis were genetically very closely related, forming a phylogenetic clade, which is possibly presenting a new family in the Diaporthales. Morphological comparisons of the Gnomonia species on the basis of commonly used criteria for the taxonomy of Diaparthales, so far did not reveal any evident features for the polyphyletic status of Gnomonia.

The only conspicuous shape variation is in metapodial length, which sometimes differs significantly among genera that are similar in all other dimensions. It follows that Discriminant Analysis (DA) intended to identify metapodials to genus will depend primarily on size, and except for the occasional like-sized genera that differ in metapodial length, DA will often confuse genera of similar size. DA of the same metapodials subjected to PCA supports this prediction. PCA further shows that bovid species that favor the same habitat often differ in metapodial size, shape, or both, and species that favor different habitats often overlap substantially in their metapodial morphometrics. DA intended to assign metapodials to habitat will thus produce different results depending on the species used to characterize each habitat type and on the number of specimens by which each species is represented. Habitat reconstruction founded in DA is therefore taxon dependent rather than taxon-free, and it cannot supplant reconstruction based on taxonomic identifications below the family level.

Here we provide estimates of queen-mating frequency for New World Neivamyrmex and Old World Aenictus species, which, compared to other army ants, have relatively small colonies and little size polymorphism among workers. To provide the first overall comparative analysis of the evolution of army ant mating systems, we combine these new results with previous estimates for African Dorylus and New World Eciton army ants, which have very large colonies and considerable worker polymorphism. We show that queens of Neivamyrmex and Aenictus mate with the same high numbers of males (usually ca. 10-20) as do queens of army ant species with very large colony sizes. We infer that multiple queen mating is ancestral in army ants and has evolved over 100 million years ago as part of the army ant adaptive syndrome. A comparison of army ants and honeybees suggests that mating systems in these two distantly related groups may have been convergently shaped by strikingly similar selective pressures.","Univ Copenhagen, Dept Populat Biol, Inst Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; LAWRENCE; 810 E 10TH STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","; data\_id:S1232; data\_collection\_article:Ward, P.S., The ant genus Leptanilloides: discovery of the male and evaluation of phylogenetic relationships based on DNA sequence data.

Monophyly of Eunicidae has been contradicted in previous molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses focusing on Eunicida or on its type genus, Eunice. The current study focused on the phylogeny of the family per se combining mitochondrial and nuclear genes in different analyses. It recovered well-resolved phylogenetic hypotheses supporting the monophyly of Eunicidae and Palola, the only monophyletic genus among the genera for which we tested their monophyly (Eunice, Marphysa, Palola, Lysidice and Nematonereis). Four other stable clades containing the type species of different genera, or species deemed very similar to them, were recovered within Eunicidae. These clades may represent monophyletic redefinitions of current genera, except for Eunice, and of previous synonymized genera. Evolution of the number of peristomial cirri and prostomial appendages in Eunicidae happened by independent step-by-step reduction in the opposite order of their ontogenetic development, suggestive of sequential heterochrony. All three genes were informative, however, at different levels within the combined trees. 16S and COI were important in recovering a monophyletic Eunicidae and relationships within the family, while 18S was important in the resolution of basal eunicidan relationships, monophyly of Onuphidae and basal relationships within this family. Moreover, results of congruence tests (SH and WRST using PABA) indicate that hidden support is picked up in the combined analyses, which is not revealed in the single gene analyses. Further supporting the idea that congruence is not a requirement for combining different partitions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Disparity between some of the forms is so great that until molecular tools were used, some annelid lineages (for example, echiurids and pogonophorans) were not commonly recognized as belonging to the group. Although it is easy to assign annelids to a given family, understanding the deeper relationships within the group has been difficult. The main working hypothesis for annelid phylogeny is based on morphological cladistic analysis. However, the recent work using molecular tools has caused a revision of our view of annelid evolutionary history. For example, Scolecida and Palpata appear not to be natural groups, and the phylogenetic positions of some aberrant taxa (for example, Siboglinidae, Poeobius, Pisione) have been determined. Herein, we discuss some of the main molecular markers that have been used to elucidate annelid phylogeny and the contribution that such work is making to our understanding.

Traditionally, plotting ti/tv ratios against genetic distances has been used to reveal saturation by assessing when ti/tv stabilizes at 1. However, interpretation of results and assessment of comparability between different data sets or partitions are rather subjective. Herein, we present the new C factor, which quantifies convergence of ti/tv ratios, thus allowing comparability. Furthermore, we introduce a comparative value for homoplasy, the O/E ratio, based on alterations of tree length. Simulation studies and an empirical example, based on annelid rRNA-gene sequences, show that the C factor correlates with noise, tree length and genetic distance and therefore is a proxy for saturation. The O/E ratio correlates with the C factor, which does not provide an intrinsic threshold of exclusion, and thus both together can objectively guide decisions to exclude saturated nucleotide positions. However, analyses also showed that, for reconstructing annelid phylogeny using Maximum Likelihood, an increase in numbers of positions improves tree reconstruction more than does the exclusion of saturated positions.

We refute Giribet's (2003a) claim that WCSA is the strictest possible test for a given phylogenetic hypothesis. Giribet's (2003a) classification of data exploration methods as evaluating ""nodal stability"" or ""nodal support"" is arbitrary, at odds with common usage and actually obscures the relationships between the methods he examined, all of which seek to assess the sensitivity of results to variation in analytical conditions. Stability, whether statistical or taxonomic, is not a goal of phylogenetic science. Statistical stability necessarily involves trial repetition, which is impossible in ideographic sciences like phylogenetics. Taxonomic stability can be nothing more than an unintended by-product of scientific inquiry, i.e., the repeated failure to refute a hypothesis. Schulmeister's (2003) ""robust-choice"" defense of WCSA does not succeed in placing non-arbitrary bounds on parameters, and her interpretation of this approach as simultaneously verificationist and falsificationist is logically inconsistent. WCSA is neither scientific nor heuristic and therefore does not contribute to the advancement of objective knowledge claims.

Here, we test three of the perceived shortcomings of a CO1 DNA barcode's utility with a group of Holarctic amphibians: primer fit, sequence variability and overlapping intra- and interspecific variability. We found that although the CO1 DNA barcode priming regions were variable, we were able to reliably amplify a CO1 fragment from degenerate primers and primers with G-C residues at the 3' end. Any overlap between intra- and interspecific variation in our taxonomic sampling was due to introgressive hybridization (Bufo/Anaxyrus), complex genetics (Ambystoma) or incomplete taxonomy (Triturus). Rates of hybridization and species discovery are not expected to be greater for amphibians than for other vertebrate groups, and thus problems with the utility of using a single mitochondrial gene for species identification will not be specific to amphibians. Therefore, we conclude that there is greater potential for a CO1 barcode's use with amphibians than has been reported to date. A large-scale effort to barcode the amphibians of the world, using the same primary barcode region of CO1, will yield important findings for science and conservation.","[Smith, M.

Phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and trnK 5' intron sequence data clearly endorse the recognition of R gemmiparus and R vaseyi as distinct species but call into question the subspecific circumscription of P. pusillus currently followed in North America. Our data resolved R pusillus in a clade with R foliosus, separated substantially from P. berchtoldii (= P. pusillus subsp. tenuissimus), thus supporting the recognition of P berchtoldii as a distinct species. Using molecular cloning techniques, we documented three clear examples of interspecific hybridization (P. foliosus x R pusillus, P. berchtoldii x P. vaseyi, and P. gemmiparus x P. vaseyi). Simple DNA polymorphisms also indicated several P berchtoldii x R gemmiparus hybrids. The narrowly distributed R gemmiparus and R clystocarpus are similar morphologically and genetically to the wide-ranging P. berchtoldii, with which they both hybridize.

In a clade of H. cuneata sibling species from widely separated Subtropical localities in the Indian Ocean, the South African sibling branches off first, leaving the Arabian and West Australian species as closest relatives.

To examine whether the differences observed in polyamines, during carposporogenesis, in the red alga Grateloupia, followed a specific pattern as is seen in other organisms, infertile axes (i.e. not showing cystocarps) were excised from the same holdfast of female fertilized individuals (i.e. showing cystocarps in other axes), and cultivated until the cystocarps became visible. Changes in the endogenous levels of free putrescine, spermidine and spermine were monitored over the 8 days of culture. The activity of enzymes related to polyamine metabolism, such as L-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), diamine oxidase and polyamine oxidase, was measured at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Up to 50\% of the infertile axes became fertile and produced cystocarps at a density of 1.91 +/- 0.1 cystocarps mm(-2) after 8 days. The endogenous content of spermine increased markedly over the first 5 days of culture, then decreased to the initial level by day 8. Spermidine followed a similar pattern to spermine, whereas putrescine remained at high levels, until day 5 when it decreased abruptly. The activity of ODC was less on day 8 than on day 0, whereas the activities of diamine oxidase and polyamine oxidase increased. In parallel experiments with explants from infertile axes, exogenously added spermine (10(-6) M) increased the number of cystocarps, and reversed the effect of cyclohexylamine (CHA), which is known to inhibit polyamine synthesis in Grateloupia. Serial sectioning and microscopic observation of specimens from explants cultivated in 10(-6) M spermine indicated that cystocarp development was induced. The results suggest that, during transition from infertile to fertile spermine is accumulated, thus favouring the development of cystocarps, given the presumed role of spermine as an inducing agent.","Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Biol, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; DORDRECHT; VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","; data\_id:S1243; data\_collection\_article:De clerck O., Gavio B., Barbara I., Fredericq S., \& Coppejans E. 2005.

Genuine R. ardissonei grows in shallow water while specimens from deep water habitats, traditionally attributed to the same species, belong to Leptofauchea, a genus placed in the Faucheaceae. The deep water growth is herein described as a new species, Leptofauchea coralligena. Female gametophytes in Leptofauchea are easily distinguished because of the presence of a tela arachnoidea in the pericarp cavity and tetrasporangia developing in nemathecia. Sterile specimens, however, can be extremely difficult to tell apart because differences in vegetative morphology and anatomy are subtle. Refractive bodies in the medullary cells form the most conspicuous diagnostic character separating L. coralligena from R. ardissonei. These structures can be easily observed in young specimens of L. coralligena, both in surface view and transverse sections. However this character becomes less obvious or even impossible to observe in mature thalli with medullary cells containing large amounts of floridean starch.

Early phylogenetic treatments of this group, and what were thought to be closely related groups (Erycinae and Pythoninae) based on morphological features, produced a relatively stable view of relationships that has strongly influenced subsequent molecular-based work. We examined 4307 base pairs (bp) of nucleotide sequence data obtained from five nuclear loci (c-mos, NT3, BDNF, RAG1, and ODC) and one mitochondrial locus (cyt b) for all genera of erycines and boines, plus representatives of other groups, including those previously thought to be closely allied with boines (Ungaliophiidae, Loxocemidae, Xenopeltidae, and Pythoninae). Our results suggest that the Boidae is not monophyletic, and its current division into three subfamilies (Erycinae, Boinae, and Pythoninae) does not accurately reflect evolutionary history. We find that the evolutionary relationships are better reflected by current geographic distributions and tectonic history than by the morphological characters that have long served as the foundation of boid phylogeny. Divergence time estimates suggest that this strong congruence between geography and phylogeny is the result of several vicariant and dispersal events in the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene associated with the fragmentation of the Gondwanan supercontinent. Our results demonstrate the importance of both vicariance and dispersal in shaping the global distributions of terrestrial organisms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Mimosa is subdivided into five sections, four of which are represented in southern South America: Botocaulon DC. Habbasia Dc. Calothamnos Barneby, and Alimosa. Previous taxonimic studies of the species from the austral region have found classification conflicts among (a) sections Batocanlon and Habbasia, (b) sections Calothamnos and Mimosa, and (c) series and subseries within section Mimosa. This paper reports a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast nucleotide sequences of the lmL intron and the lmL-lmF intergenic spacer from 34 species of Mimosa and related genera. Key morphological characters were mapped onto the phylogenetic hypothesis and discussed. Sequence analysis indicates that the genus Mimosa is monophyletic; it is derived from Piptadenia riridiflora (Kunth) Benth. The four sections proposed by Barneby are not natural groups. The cladogram retrieved indicates that the representatives of Mimosa seet. Batocaulon are not clustered, the xerophylous represnetatives of this section are basal, and the remaining species are related to those species of section Habbasia, suggesting that section Batocaulon ser. Stipellares is more recently derived. The species of Mimosa sect. Calothamnos that were analyzed are nestd in section Mimosa. The results seem to support retention of this section within section mimosa as was noted previously by Bentham.

Olearia traversiorum is the correct species epithet for plants previously known as O. traversii because the protologue for the species clearly and unambiguously states that the name commemorates both W.

The first focuses on the extent to which human history is tree-like (its shape), and the second on the unity of that history (its fabric). Proponents of cultural phylogenetics are often accused of assuming that human history has been both highly tree-like and consisting of tightly linked lineages. Critics have pointed out obvious exceptions to these assumptions. Instead of a priori dichotomous disputes about the validity of cultural phylogenetics, we suggest that the debate is better conceptualized as involving positions along continuous dimensions. The challenge for empirical research is, therefore, to determine where particular aspects of culture lie on these dimensions. We discuss the ability of current computational methods derived from evolutionary biology to address these questions. These methods are then used to compare the extent to which lexical evolution is tree-like in different parts of the world and to evaluate the coherence of cultural and linguistic lineages.","[Gray, Russell D.; Bryant, David; Greenhill, Simon J.] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Bryant, David] Univ Otago, Dept Math \& Stat, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; LONDON; 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1257; data\_collection\_article:Kennedy M., Holland B., Gray R., \& Spencer H. 2005.

Therefore, at least three long-distance directional dispersal events into NewZealand can be inferred for Plantago, likely from Australian ancestors. This result differs from the biogeographic pattern often reported for New Zealand plant genera of a single dispersal event followed by rapid radiation, and may be attributed to ready biotic dispersal of mucilaginous seeds and habitat similarities of the Australasian species. Molecular dating placed the arrival time and diversification of the New Zealand species between 2.291 and 0.5 million years ago, which coincides with the geological dates for the uplift of mountain ranges in New Zealand.

They have been allied to different Phyllodocida taxa. Although originally associated with Glyceridae and Phyllodocidae, they are more recently considered to be related to scale worms. Scale worms are a well-defined taxon, Aphroditiformia, within Annelida due to the unique possession of dorsal scales called elytra. Pisionidae lack elytra but they have been grouped with scale worms because they possess two pairs of jaws with venom glands, also found in Glyceridae. Determining the phylogenetic position of Pisionidae is important for understanding if features such as elytra and venomous jaws are evolutionarily labile in annelid history. Therefore, we explored 18S rDNA and Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I data from several Aphroditiformia, Pisionidae, and other Phyllodocida to determine the phylogenetic placement of Pisionidae. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of separate and combined data sets were conducted. All analyses support a derived position of Pisionidae within Aphroditiformia, close to Pholoidae and Sigalionidae. The loss of elytra in Pisionidae is probably due to adaptation for interstitial life. Furthermore, the results reject a monophyletic Aphroditoidea comprising Acoetidae, Aphroditidae, Eulepethidae and Polynoidae. Thus, the possession of only simple chaetae is either symplesiomorphic or convergent.","Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; Univ Osnabruck, D-4500 Osnabruck, Germany; OSLO; PO BOX 12 POSTHUSET, NO-0051 OSLO, NORWAY","; data\_id:S1268; data\_collection\_article:Burnette, A.B., T.H.

Comparison with a molecular phylogenetic tree based on ITS DNA sequences identified two separate occurrences of sinalbin. The first in a group of species related to S. alba (including members of the genera Coincya and Kremeriella): and the second in S. arvensis, nested among sinalbin deficient species. Significant 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile degrading enzyme activity was found in both S. alba and S. arvensis, but in S. alba the major product was the corresponding carboxylic acid, while in S. arvensis the major product was the amide. Both investigated enzyme activities, nitrilase and nitrile hydratase, were specific, accepting only certain arylacetonitriles such as 4-hydroxy and 4-methoxyphenylacetonitrile. Only the S. alba enzyme required an oxygen in para position of the substrate, as found in sinalbin. Indole-3-acetonitrile, arylcyanides, and arylpropionitriles were poor substrates. The nitrilase activity of S. alba was quantitatively comparable to that reported in the monocot Sorghum bicolor (believed to be involved in cyanogenic glycoside metabolism). Glucosinolates derived from methionine were found in all Sinapis clades. Glucosinolate patterns suggested a complex evolution of glucosinolates in the investigated species, with several apparent examples of abrupt changes in glucosinolate profiles including chain length variation and appearance of glucosinolates derived from branched-chain amino acids. NMR data for desulfated homosinalbin, 9-methylsulphonylnonylglucosinolate, 3-methylpentylglucosinolate and related glucosinolates are reported, and a facultative connection between sinalbin and specific nitrilases is suggested.

The dynamics of this process is unknown, as it has so far been impossible to date individual rearrangement events. In this paper, we present evidence demonstrating that the majority of rearrangements occurred before the Arabidopsis-Brassica split 20-24 Mya, and that the segmental architecture of the A. thaliana genome is predominantly conserved in Brassica. This finding is based on the conservation of four rearrangement breakpoints analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and RFLP mapping of three A. thaliana chromosomal regions. For this purpose, 95 Arabidopsis bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) spanning a total of 8.25 Mb and 81 genetic loci for 36 marker genes were studied in the Brassica oleracea genome. All the regions under study were triplicated in the B. oleracea genome, confirming the hypothesis of Brassica ancestral genome triplication. However, whilst one of the breakpoints was conserved at one locus, it was not at the two others. Further comparison of their organization may indicate that the evolution of the hexaploid Brassica progenitor proceeded by several events, separated in time. Genetic mapping and reprobing with rDNA allowed assignment of the regions to particular Brassica chromosomes. Based on this study of regional organization and evolution, a new insight into polyploidization/diploidization cycles is proposed.","Adam Mickiewicz Univ Poznan, Dept Biotechnol, PL-60371 Poznan, Poland; Polish Acad Sci, Inst Plant Genet, PL-60479 Poznan, Poland; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1274; data\_collection\_article:Warwick, S.I. and C.A.

Maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum-likelihood analyses all support the separate recognition of three distinct and generally well-supported clades. The largest corresponds to the North-South American Thelypodieae (27 genera: Catadysia, Caulanthus, Chaunanthus, Chilocardamum, Chlorocrambe, Coelophragmus, Dictyophragmus, Dryopetalon, Englerocharis, Hesperidanthus, Mostacillastrum, Neuontobotrys, Polypsecadium, Pringlea, Pterygiosperma, Romanschulzia, Sibara, Sibaropsis, Stanleya, Streptanthella, Streptanthus, Thelypodiopsis, Thelypodium, Thysanocarpus, Warea, Weberbauera, and Werdermannia). The remaining six South American Schizopetaleae genera were divided into two clades: SCHIZ I of four genera (Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Eudema, and Onuris) and SCHIZ II Schizopetaleae s. str.: Mathewsia, and Schizopetalon). Resolution within the Thelypodieae clade was limited in both the ITS- and ndhF-based phylogenies. Based on ITS sequence data, elements of the Old World tribe Brassiceae were sister to the Thelypodieae, whereas the ndhF data strongly supported the Sisymbrieae as sister to the Thelypodieae, and the Brassiceae as sister to both tribes. Sister groups to the Schizopetaleae clades I and II were not clearly resolved, Morphological and cytological data support the separation of these three clades. In SCHIZ II, the sepals are always erect to form a closed tube, and the trichomes are mostly dendritic, although other types also occur. In both the Thelypodieae and SCHIZ I clades, the sepals are variously oriented but never form a closed tube, whereas the trichomes are either absent, or simple, forked, or rarely dendritic. The latter clade differs from both SCHIZ II and Thelypodieae by lacking trichomes or rarely having forked ones and by having exclusively basal, entire leaves. Thelypodieae circumscription should be restricted in future to the Thelypodieae clade, Schizopetaleae circumscription to the SCHIZ II clade, while a new tribe is needed for the SCHIZ I clade.","[Warwick, Suzanne I.; Sauder, Connie A.] Agr \& Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal \& Oilseed Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Mayer, Michael S.] Univ San Diego, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Al-Shenbaz, Ihsan A.] Missouri Bot Garden, St Louis, MO","; data\_id:S1274; data\_collection\_article:Warwick, S.I. and C.A.

An additional sulphate ester (the sulphate ester of 4-hydroxyphenylacetamide) was excreted when the caterpillars were reared on two plant species (Sinapis alba and Sinapis arvensis) that contained sinalbin naturally. Artificial addition of sinalbin to S. arvensis leaves resulted in increased levels of the sulphated amide, and an enzymatic activity (nitrile hydratase) explaining the formation of the sulphated amide from sinalbin was detected in both Sinapis species, but not in A. thaliana. In agreement with the suggested minor metabolic pathway, the caterpillars were able to sulphate 4-hydroxyphenylacetamide offered as part of an artificial diet. In fact, phenol and seven para-substituted phenol derivatives with substituents of moderate size were sulphated and excreted, but all tested phenols devoid of a nitrile functional group were less efficiently sulphated than the primary sinalbin detoxification product, 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile. This suggests that the specificity of the sulphation step involved in sinalbin metabolism may be adapted to nitriles formed as metabolites of phenolic glucosinolates. On the contrary, there was no specificity for products (4-hydroxybenzylascorbigen and 4-hydroxybenzylalcohol) derived from the semistable isothiocyanate produced from sinalbin in the absence of nitrile specifier protein.

Recent studies using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences suggested the presence of four different lineages (putative species). The objective of the study was to investigate the spatial distribution of these lineages/species and, in particular, to test the hypothesis of a spatial differentiation, at various scales: regional (France), altitudinal (a Pyrenean transect) and local (within a forest plot). Detection methods for the four ITS types were developed: (1) single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP); (2) PCR amplifications, for which specific primers were designed. SSCP proved to be efficient for the detection of Erysiphe alphitoides and E. quercicola types. In contrast, the rarer ITS types corresponding to E. hypophylla and Phyllactinia guttata (sensu lato) were only detected by specific amplification. The study confirmed the strong predominance of the ITS sequence associated with E. alphitoides at all spatial scales (with a frequency higher than 80\%). Isolates presumably belonging to E. quercicola (i.e. with same ITS type), a recently described species not yet recorded in Europe, were also found in all French regions at a significant frequency (15\% at national level). No pattern of spatial differentiation between the putative species could be demonstrated: E. alphitoides was often found in association with different ITS types in the same region, the same tree, and even in the same lesion.","[Mougou-Hamdane, Amira; Dutech, Cyril; Desprez-Loustau, Marie-Laure] INRA, BIOGECO UMR1202, Equipe Pathol Forestiere, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Giresse, Xavier] INRA, Sante Vegetale UMR1065, Equipe Divers \& Adaptat Populat Bioagresseurs, F-33140","; data\_id:S1277; data\_collection\_article:Limkaisang S., Kom-un S., Furtado E., Liew K., Salleh B., Sato Y., \& Takamatsu S. 2005.

Our Bayesian phylogenetic estimate for Crotaphytidae is based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence data for 408 individuals representing the 12 extant species of Crotaphytus and Gambelia. The mitochondrial phylogeny disagrees in several respects with a previously published morphological tree, as well as with conventional species designations, and we conclude that some of this disagreement stems from hybridization-mediated mitochondrial introgression, as well as from incomplete lineage sorting. Unidirectional introgression of Crotaphytus collaris (western collared lizard) mitochondria into C. reticulatus (reticulate collared lizard) populations in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas has resulted in the replacement of ancestral C. reticulatus mitochondria over approximately two-thirds of the total range of the species, a linear distance of similar to 270 km. Introgression of C. collaris mitochondria into C. bicinctores (Great Basin collared lizard) populations in southwestern Arizona requires a more complex scenario because at least three temporally separated and superimposed introgression events appear to have occurred in this region. We propose an ""introgression conveyor"" model to explain this unique pattern of mitochondrial variation in this region. We show with ecological niche modeling that the predicted geographical ranges of C. collaris, C. bicinctores, and C. reticulatus during glacial maxima could have provided enhanced opportunities for past hybridization. Our analyses suggest that incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression has further confounded the phylogenetic placements of additional species including C. nebrius, C. vestigium, C. insularis, C. grismeri, and perhaps G. copei. Despite many independent instances of interspecific hybridization among crotaphytid lizards, the species continue to maintain morphological and geographic cohesiveness throughout their ranges.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol \& Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum \& Biodivers Res Ctr, Law","; data\_id:S1278; data\_collection\_article:Lindell, J., F.R.

In this study we found that production of ergot alkaloids was a feature of Clavicipitaceae that were biotrophs on plants. Ergoline alkaloid-producing plant biotrophs were distributed in two clades of the Clavicipitaceae that included plant biotrophic forms. This is the first study that links ergot alkaloid production in the Clavicipitaceae with plant biotrophy. To explain this linkage we offer the hypothesis that the abundance of nutrients in living plants may permit the plant biotrophic forms to produce ergot alkaloids for defensive purposes. The exposure of these fungi on the surfaces of plants increases their vulnerability to herbivory; production of ergot alkaloids reduces that vulnerability.","[Torres, Monica S.; Singh, Ajay P.; White, James F., Jr.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol \& Pathol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Vorsa, Nicholi] Rutgers State Univ, Marucci Blueberry Cranberry Res Ctr, Chatsworth, NJ 08019 USA; REHOVOT; PO BOX 2039,","; data\_id:S1279; data\_collection\_article:Chaverri P., Bischoff J., Liu M., \& Hodge K. 2005.

However, recent reports provide conflicting support for the pattern, questioning whether Bergmann's clines are generally present in amphibians. In this study, we measured 96,996 adult Plethodon from 3974 populations to test for the presence of Bergmann's clines in these salamanders. Only three Plethodon species exhibited a significant negative correlation between body size and temperature consistent with Bergmann's rule, whereas 37 of 40 species did not display a pattern consistent with this prediction. Further, a phylogenetic comparative analysis found no relationship between body size and temperature among species. A meta-analysis combining our data with the available data for other amphibian species revealed no support for Bergmann's rule at the genus (Plethodon), order (Caudata), or class (Amphibia) levels. Our findings strongly suggest that negative thermal body size clines are not common in amphibians, and we conclude that Bergmann's rule is not generally applicable to these taxa. Thus, evolutionary explanations of Bergmann's clines in other tetrapods need not account for unique life-history attributes of amphibians.","[Adams, Dean C.; Church, James O.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut \& Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Adams, Dean C.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1281; data\_collection\_article:Cruz, F.B., et al., The importance of phylogenetic scale in tests of Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules: lessons from a clade of South American lizards.

In a clade of H. cuneata sibling species from widely separated Subtropical localities in the Indian Ocean, the South African sibling branches off first, leaving the Arabian and West Australian species as closest relatives.

The assay takes advantage of universal primers that amplify a region from the trnL (UAA) intron of every plant species. The results showed that amplicons from all species can be accurately discriminated apart from olive and avocado. Single-base primer extension was then proposed as an additional methodology to discriminate the two species and to confirm the results of the former approach. These assays were successfully applied on olive and sesame oils, thus confirming the validity of this approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Divergence times in the family have previously been estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing (NPRS) and penalized likelihood (PL). Here we use an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock in BEAST to estimate diversification times of the main clades within the family with a focus on the Asian genus Pseuduvaria within the SBC. Two fossil calibration points are applied, including the first use of the recently discovered Annonaceae fossil Futabanthus. The taxonomy and morphology of Pseuduvaria have been well documented, although no previous dating or biogeographical studies have been undertaken. Ancestral areas at internal nodes within Pseuduvaria are determined using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and weighted ancestral area analysis (WAAA). Results: The divergence times of the main clades within the Annonaceae were found to deviate slightly from previous estimates that used different calibration points and dating methods. In particular, our estimate for the SBC crown (55.2-26.9 Mya) is much younger than previous estimates (62.5-53.1 +/- 3.6 Mya and ca. 58.76 Mya). Early diversification of Pseuduvaria was estimated to have occurred 15-8 Mya, possibly associated with the 'mid-Miocene climatic optimum.' Pseuduvaria is inferred to have originated in Sundaland in the late Miocene, ca. 8 Mya; subsequent migration events were predominantly eastwards towards New Guinea and Australia, although several migratory reversals are also postulated. Speciation of Pseuduvaria within New Guinea may have occurred after ca. 6.5 Mya, possibly coinciding with the formation of the Central Range orogeny from ca. 8 Mya. Conclusion: Our divergence time estimates within the Annonaceae are likely to be more precise as we used a UCLD clock model and calibrated the phylogeny using new fossil evidence. Pseuduvaria is shown to have dispersed from Sundaland after the late Miocene. The present-day paleotropical distribution of Pseuduvaria may have been achieved by long-distance dispersal, and speciation events might be explained by global climatic oscillations, sea level fluctuations, and tectonic activity.","[Su, Yvonne C.

There remain many conflicts between morphological analyses and hypotheses based on DNA data, the latter principally derived from 18S rRNA sequences. For the present study a data set covering a broad range of polychaete diversity was assembled, including 38 new sequences from 21 species. Besides available 18S rRNA data, five additional gene segments were examined: the D1 and D9-10 expansion regions of 28S rRNA, histone H3, snU2 RNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were conducted. Annelida and Mollusca were reciprocally monophyletic in maximum likelihood analyses, but Polychaeta included a cephalopod in maximum parsimony analyses, and a patellogastropod in Bayesian analyses. When rooted on the Mollusca, optimal topologies from maximum likelihood analyses showed a recognisable basal group of taxa, including Oweniidae, Chaetopteridae and Amphinomidae. The six studied phyllodocidan families plus Orbiniidae (as the sister group of the scale-worms) formed the next most basal group. All analyses support the inclusion of Echiura, Clitellata and Siboglinidae within polychaetes. Bayesian analyses show Echiura as the sister group of Capitellidae, in agreement with previous 18S rRNA results, In contrast, Echiura formed the sister group to Trichobranchidae in maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses. Supra-familial groupings consistently recovered within Polychaeta in the analyses are: (i) Terebellida without Ampharetidae; (ii) Scolecida (excepting Orbiniidae); (iii) Eunicidae, Lumbrineridae and Clitellata; and (iv) ""Cirratuliformia"" (including Sternaspidae) plus Sabellidae, Serpulidae and Spionidae.

Sclerotia of UN isolates were dark brown in color and larger in size (I to 3 mm in diameter) than those of AG-D subgroup I (I mm in diameter), whereas isolates of AG-D II produced white mycelial clamps 4 to 5 mm in size. Hyphal growth rate of UN isolates was slower than that of two AG-D subgroups at several temperatures, especially 25 degrees C. In pathogenicity tests on Japanese zoysia grass, UN isolates showed moderate disease severity and lower pathogenicity than isolates of AG-D subgroups I and II. Sequences of the rDNA-ITS region within UN isolates were almost homologous, but had lower homology with subgroups AG-D I or II. Phylogenetic trees constructed using ITS sequences showed that UN isolates formed an individual cluster that differed from the clusters of the two subgroups. We propose that UN isolates are a new subgroup of Rhizoctonia AG-D, subgroup III, and the name of the disease is ""spring-rot"" on Japanese zoysia grass.","Riken Green Co Ltd, Res Inst, Shizuoka 4371212, Japan; Gifu Univ, Plant Pathol Lab, Fac Appl Biol Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; Gifu Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Gifu 5011193, Japan; ST PAUL; 3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA","; data\_id:S1294; data\_collection\_article:Hyakumachi M., Priyatmojo A., Kubota M., \& Fukui H. 2005.

Compared to the description of Moesziomyces genus sensus Vanky, our samples presented morphological differences: i) presence of a columella-like structure in sori; ii) surface ornamentations of teliospores; iii) teliospore germination similar to Ustilago and Sporisorium ones. We investigated the systematic position of our samples by aligning their Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequences of the ribosomal regions with 47 sequences from Ustilaginaceae. The resulting tree rooted with Tolyposporium junci allowed the separation of five groups among which, they are, two Ustilago and two Sporisorium. An independent clade is formed by Tranzscheliella williamsii and Tranzscheliella hypodytes species including Ustilago sparti.

The cranium of E. lambondrano is similar to that of E. aegyptiacum from the middle Eocene of Egypt in aspects of both morphology and size but the Upper Molars of E. lambondrano are considerably longer and wider and it has longer, narrower nasals.

The diversity of their morphology and incomplete taxon sampling made it difficult until now to resolve phylogenies based on either morphology or molecular data for this group. Therefore, in order to delineate the evolutionary history of this family, phylogenetic and dating analyses were performed on a four nuclear genes dataset (ADRA2B, AR, GHR and vWF) including all Malagasy tenrec genera. Moreover, the influence of both taxon sampling and data partitioning on the accuracy of the estimated ages were assessed. Results: Within Afrotheria the vast majority of the nodes received a high support, including the grouping of hyrax with sea cow and the monophyly of both Afroinsectivora (Macroscelidea + Afrosoricida) and Afroinsectiphillia (Tubulidentata + Afroinsectivora). Strongly supported relationships were also recovered among all tenrec genera, allowing us to firmly establish the grouping of Geogale with Oryzorictinae, and to confirm the previously hypothesized nesting of Limnogale within the genus Microgale. The timeline of Malagasy tenrec diversification does not reflect a fast adaptive radiation after the arrival on Madagascar, indicating that morphological specializations have appeared over the whole evolutionary history of the family, and not just in a short period after colonization. In our analysis, age estimates at the root of a clade became older with increased taxon sampling of that clade. Moreover an augmentation of data partitions resulted in older age estimates as well, whereas standard deviations increased when more extreme partition schemes were used. Conclusion: Our results provide as yet the best resolved gene tree comprising all Malagasy tenrec genera, and may lead to a revision of tenrec taxonomy. A timeframe of tenrec evolution built on the basis of this solid phylogenetic framework showed that morphological specializations of the tenrecs may have been affected by environmental changes caused by climatic and/or subsequent colonization events. Analyses including various taxon sampling and data partitions allow us to point out some possible pitfalls that may lead to biased results in molecular dating; however, further analyses are needed to corroborate these observations.","[Poux, Celine; Madsen, Ole; de Jong, Wilfried W.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Biomol Chem 271, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Glos, Julian; Vences, Miguel] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Div Evolut Biol, Inst Zool, D-38106 Braunschweig, Ger","; data\_id:S1301; data\_collection\_article:Poux C., Madsen O., Marquard E., Vieites D., Jong W., \& Vences M. 2005.

Proscoloplos consists of three nominal species, but molecular analyses of the variable ITS1 and ITS2 region revealed no clade support for samples from South Africa, France and Australia, representing at least two of these nominal species. We found no unambiguous diagnostic characters for the three different species even with scanning electron microscopy. Two main characters-first appearance of branchiae and hooks-that were used for species delineation show considerable intrapopulational variation and do not withstand critical evaluation. The obtained data and the observed regenerative capabilities point to a cautious use of the position of branchiae and hooked chaetae as taxonomic marker in Proscoloplos. After experimental bisection of animals, the recovery led to a phenotype without recognizable signs of regeneration, but neither branchiae nor hooked chaetae reoccurred at the same initial segmental position. Summarising the molecular and morphological data we suggest the synonymy of the known Proscoloplos species under the senior synonym Proscoloplos cygnochaetus Day, 1967.

Amongst these, approximately 60 Mycosphaerella spp. have been identified from various Eucalyptus spp. where they cause leaf diseases collectively known as Mycosphaerella Leaf Disease (MLD). Species concepts for this group of fungi remain confused, and hence their species identification is notoriously difficult. Thus, the introduction of DNA sequence comparisons has become the definitive characteristic used to distinguish species of Mycosphaerella. Sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA operon have most commonly been used to consider species boundaries in Mycosphaerella. However, sequences for this gene region do not always provide sufficient resolution for cryptic taxa. The aim of this study was, therefore, to use DNA sequences for three loci, ITS, Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1 alpha) and Actin (ACT) to reconsider species boundaries for Mycosphaerella spp. from Eucalyptus. A further aim was to study the anamorph concepts and resolve the deeper nodes of Mycosphaerella, for which part of the Large Subunit (LSU) of the nuclear rRNA operon was sequenced. The ITS and EF-1 alpha gene regions were found to be useful, but the ACT gene region did not provide species-level resolution in Mycosphaerelia.

They include a number of asexual (anamorphic) genera taxonomically segregated from Sporidesmium sensu lato and are similar in having schizolytic conidial secession. The taxonomy of these ubiquitous asexual fungi and their affinities with known Ascomycetes are, however, still obscure. This study incorporates a phylogenetic investigation, based on the LSU nu-rDNA and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) gene sequence, to assess the possible familial placement of Ellisembia, Linkosia, Repetophragma, Sporidesmiella, Sporidesmium and Stanjehughesia, and justify whether anamorphic characters are proper phylogenetic indicators. Phylogenies provide conclusive evidence to suggest that Sporidesmium is not monopyletic and species are phylogenetically distributed in two major ascomycete classes, Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes. Morphologies currently used in their classification have undergone convergent evolution and are not phylogenetically reliable. The possible teleomorphic affinities of these anamorphic genera are discussed in light of morphology and molecular data. As these anamorphs, in most cases, are the sole known morph of the holomorph, it is proposed that in the absence of or failure to detect their teleomorphic phase, the anamorph names should be used for the holomorph.

While not uncommon in bilateral organisms in general, asymmetry in spiders is rare. Here I report the first case of antisymmetry in external female genitalia in spiders, in the new genus Asygyna (Theridiidae: Araneae) from Madagascar. In the nearly 39 000 species of spiders described to date, the external structure of the female genitalia is symmetric. In entelegyne spiders paired external copulatory openings each lead to an internal copulatory duct, whose roughly symmetrical trajectories terminate in paired receptacles, the spermathecae. In Asygyna, here exemplified by two new species, A. huberi and A. coddingtoni, laterality is evident in the internal and external female genitalia. A single copulatory opening leads (either to the left or right depending on the individual) to a single copulatory duct with a distinctly asymmetric trajectory. The duct splits terminally shortly before entering the two spermathecae. The males are symmetric, but possibly only one palp can be used in copulation with each female. If adaptive, the selective forces behind this asymmetry are perplexing, as male access to females seems reduced. However, if males are plentiful, asymmetry may benefit the female by reducing insertion times and thus shortening copulation time, and by tightening her control over which males sire her offspring. Asygyna has a range of other bizarre sex-related morphologies, including prosomal pits and a well developed stridulatory mechanism in both sexes, a male proboscis, and simplified palps. A phylogenetic analysis, including 63 taxa and 242 morphological characters, places Asygyna in Pholcommatinae, sister to the enigmatic genus Carniella.

The five previously known species are redescribed: Clitaetra clathrata Simon from western Africa, C. simoni Benoit from central Africa, C. episinoides Simon from the Comoro Islands and Mayotte, C. perroti Simon from Madagascar, and C. thisbe Simon from Sri Lanka with first descriptions of the males of C. clathrata and C. perroti. Additionally, C. irenae sp. nov. is described in both sexes from southern Africa. Clitaetra biology, so far largely unknown, is presented here based on observations of C. irenae in South Africa, and clitaetrine anatomy is summarized to assess phylogenetic homologies. A species-level phylogenetic analysis of 32 taxa scored for 197 morphological and behavioural characters results in eight most parsimonious cladograms and places Clitaetra as sister to the clade (Herennia+ (Nephilengys+Nephila)). Thus, the orb-weaving spider family Nephilidae Simon contains the (sub)tropical genera Nephila, Nephilengys, Herennia, and Clitaetra, but not Deliochus or Phonognatha. Contra recent cladistic treatments, the nephilines are not tetragnathids, but the sister group to the newly proposed clade, Nephilidae, is ambiguous. The three species clades (subgenera) within Clitaetra show a seemingly old Gondwanan biogeographic pattern: Afroetra subgen. nov., with the three mainland African species, is sister to Clitaetra with the two Indian Ocean island species. Indoetra subgen. nov. contains the unstudied species from Sri Lanka, C. thisbe. Future understanding of the morphology and biology of C. thisbe is important for the polarization of many nephilid features. Vicariance would estimate the clitaetrine subgeneric clades and basal nephilid lineages to be at least 160 Myr old and of Gondwanan origin.","Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Entomol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1325; data\_collection\_article:Agnarsson, I., A revision and phylogenetic analysis of the American ethicus and rupununi groups of Anelosimus (Araneae, Theridiidae).

Web construction includes several stages: construction of the scaffolding that serves to support the rest of the web; filling in the dome-shaped and horizontal sheets; and construction of the upper tangle. During construction of the scaffolding, the spider descends by a pre-existing thread to the substrate, moves a few centimeters and attaches the dragline, then she ascends by the new thread, doubling the line or attaching it to another thread. The spider fills in the sheet while walking in an irregular pattern under the sheet, and attaching her dragline using either one or both legs IV simultaneously to hold pre-existing sheet lines against her spinnerets. During scaffolding construction and filling in the dome-shaped sheet, the spider returns frequently to the retreat, apparently using the same threads near the retreat each time. Threads of both the dome-shaped sheet and the horizontal sheet have small drops of viscid material. The dome-shaped sheet and upper tangle comprise the functional trap of the web, while the horizontal sheet apparently plays only a little role in prey capture.","[Madrigal-Brenes, Ruth; Barrantes, Gilbert] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose, Costa Rica; COLLEGE PARK; UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT ENTOMOLOGY, 4112 PLANT SCIENCES BLDG, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20742-4454 USA","; data\_id:S1325; data\_collection\_article:Agnarsson, I., A revision and phylogenetic analysis of the American ethicus and rupununi groups of Anelosimus (Araneae, Theridiidae).

This is the first step in a fascinating sexual biology observed in both genera, which is marked by sexual dimorphism males are tiny compared with females - and usually involves both emasculation and sexual cannibalism. To study the evolution of these striking traits it is essential to understand the phylogenetic relationship of these genera. Both morphological and molecular data place Tidarren in the subfamily Theridiinae. However, Echinotheridion has not been placed phylogenetically to date owing to rarity of specimens, and difficulty of interpreting the highly autapomorphic palpal organ, the main source of morphological characters. Here, the phylogenetic position of Echinotheridion is inferred using fragments of three nuclear (Histone 3, 18S rDNA, and 28S rDNA) and two mitochondrial (16S rDNA and COI) loci. Each matrix separately, and a combined matrix, were analysed using parsimony with gaps either treated as missing data, or as 5th state, and with Bayesian methods. Although all genes agree that Tidarren and Echinotheridion are closely related, perhaps surprisingly, none of the analyses supported their sister relationship. The sister relationship was ambiguously supported in a preliminary morphological analysis, whereas combined molecular and morphological data refuted it. This implies a more complex evolutionary history of male sexual organ removal and other bizarre sexual biology of Tidarren and Echinotheridion than previously envisioned. Many of the analyses are equally consistent with two hypotheses: a single origin, followed by a secondary loss; or independent evolution of this behaviour in the two genera. However, based on the combined molecular Bayesian phylogeny, and some of the preliminary 'total evidence' analyses, the latter hypothesis is better supported.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Smithsonian Inst, Dept Entomol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; COLLINGWOOD; 150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066,","; data\_id:S1325; data\_collection\_article:Agnarsson, I., A revision and phylogenetic analysis of the American ethicus and rupununi groups of Anelosimus (Araneae, Theridiidae).

Spiders cooperated in prey capture and shared their food. Subadult to young adult sex ratios were highly female biased, suggesting a strongly subdivided population structure as in other permanent-social spiders. Unusual aspects of T. nigroannulatum's biology include the existence of adult females of two discrete sizes, an extreme boom and bust pattern of colony growth, and the presence, within larger colonies, of populations of a predatory spider (Faiditus spp., Argyrodinae) that may play the role of a colony-level parasite. The existence of females of two sizes may be the result of alternative female reproductive strategies, intracolony competition for resources, or an incipient caste system in this species.

This is not true, however, for Pereskia (Cactaceae), the 17 species of leafy trees and shrubs that represent the earliest diverging lineages of the cacti. Here we report on the water relations and photosynthesis of Pereskia guamacho, a small tree of the semiarid scrubland of Venezuela's Caribbean coast. Sapwood-specific xylem conductivity (K-sp) is low when compared to other vessel-bearing trees of tropical dry systems, but leaf-specific xylem conductivity is relatively high due to the high Huber value afforded by P. guamacho's short shoot architecture. P. guamacho xylem is not particularly vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation, especially considering the high leaf water potentials maintained year round. This is confirmed by the lack of significant variation exhibited in K-sp between wet and dry seasons. In the rainy season, P. guamacho exhibited C-3-like patterns of stomatal conductance, but during a prolonged drought we documented nocturnal stomatal opening with a concomitant accumulation of titratable acid in leaves. This suggests that P. guamacho can perform drought-induced crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM photosynthesis), although delta C-13 values imply that most carbon is assimilated via the C-3 pathway. P. guamacho leaves display very low stomatal densities, and maximum stomatal conductance is low whether stomata open during the day or night. We conclude that leaf performance is not limited by stem hydraulic capacity in this species, and that water use is conservative and tightly regulated at the leaf level.","Yale Univ, Dept Ecol \& Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; Univ Expt Francisco de Miranda, CIEZA, Coro, Venezuela; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1327; data\_collection\_article:Edwards, E.J., R.

A rapid method was used to characterise genetic variation among 61 isolates of P. clandestina belonging to eight pathogenic races based on DNA sequencing and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses of the beta-tubulin gene of the pathogen. The beta-tubulin gene among those tested displayed a high degree of variability among isolates. Cluster analysis of the SSCP profiles grouped the 61 isolates into two main clusters (A and B). Cluster A with 3 subclusters viz; I (race 177), II (race 000) and III (races 001, 121, 101, 143 and 157) and B with race 173 alone. In addition, SSCP of beta-tubulin also successfully differentiated between races 173 and 177, the two most prevalent and most virulent of the races studied. This is the first time that the beta-tubulin gene has been used to study intra-species variation in this pathogen. In addition to showing relationship among the strains, it also provides a practical means for rapid monitoring of current and future differences in the distribution of P. clandestina strains, giving subterranean clover breeders and farmers a sound basis for the selection/breeding and deployment of appropriate cultivars to counter the predominant strain populations in specific localities.","[Ma, X.

These problems are aptly illustrated in the genus Phoma. This phytopathologically significant fungal genus is currently subdivided into nine sections which are mainly based on a single or just a few morphological characters. However, this subdivision is ambiguous as several of the section-specific characters can occur within a single species. In addition, many teleomorph genera have been linked to Phoma, three of which are recognised here. In this study it is attempted to delineate generic boundaries, and to come to a generic circumscription which is more correct from an evolutionary point of view by means of multilocus sequence typing. Therefore, multiple analyses were conducted utilising sequences obtained from 28S nrDNA (Large Subunit - LSU), 18S nrDNA (Small Subunit - SSU), the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 \& 2 and 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), and part of the beta-tubulin (TUB) gene region. A total of 324 strains were included in the analyses of which most belonged to Phoma taxa, whilst 54 to related pleosporalean fungi. In total, 206 taxa were investigated, of which 159 are known to have affinities to Phoma. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the current Boeremaean subdivision is incorrect from an evolutionary point of view, revealing the genus to be highly polyphyletic. Phoma species are retrieved in six distinct clades within the Pleosporales, and appear to reside in different families. The majority of the species, however, including the generic type, clustered in a recently established family, Didymellaceae. In the second part of this study, the phylogenetic variation of the species and varieties in this clade was further assessed. Next to the genus Didymella, which is considered to be the sole teleomorph of Phoma s. str., we also retrieved taxa belonging to the teleomorph genera Leptosphaerulina and Macroventuria in this clade. Based on the sequence data obtained, the Didymellaceae segregate into at least 18 distinct clusters, of which many can be associated with several specific taxonomic characters. Four of these clusters were defined well enough by means of phylogeny and morphology, so that the associated taxa could be transferred to separate genera. Aditionally, this study addresses the taxonomic description of eight species and two varieties that are novel to science, and the recombination of 61 additional taxa.","[Aveskamp, M.

Twenty isolates of P. aphanidermatum from diverse hosts from different countries were also included in the study. Most isolates from Oman were found to be aggressive on cucumber seedlings and all were highly sensitive to metalaxyl (EC50 < 0.80 mu g mL(-1)). Isolates from cucumber and muskmelon were as aggressive as each other on both hosts (P > 0.05), which implies a lack of host specialization in P. aphanidermatum on these two hosts in Oman. AFLP analysis of all isolates using four primer-pair combinations resolved 152 bands, of which 61 (similar to 40\%) were polymorphic. Isolates of P. aphanidermatum from Oman and other countries exhibited high genetic similarity (mean = 94.1\%) and produced 59 different AFLP profiles. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that most AFLP variation among populations of P. aphanidermatum in Oman was associated with geographical regions (F-ST = 0.118; P < 0.0001), not hosts (F-ST = -0.004; P = 0.4323). These data were supported by the high rate of recovery (24\%) of identical phenotypes between cucumber and muskmelon fields in the same region as compared to the low recovery (10\%) across regions in Oman, which suggests more frequent movement of Pythium inoculum among muskmelon and cucumber fields in the same region compared to movement across geographically separated regions. However, recovering clones among regions and different countries may imply circulation of Pythium inoculum via common sources in Oman and also intercontinental spread of isolates.","[Al-Sa'di, A.

However, yields are often reduced by various root pathogens, including Pythium species, which cause damping-off in young plants. In order to improve the prediction of disease risk, real-time PCR assays were developed and used in conjunction with dilution plating on selective media to quantify populations of Pythium irregulare Buisman and Pythium ultimum Trow directly from soil. The assays were tested on artificially infested soils and then used on a variety of naturally infested, ginseng-cultivated soils in south-western Ontario. Data on P. ultimum DNA concentrations were positively correlated with the number of P. ultimum viable propagules on selective media. However, in the case of P. irregulare, the presence of cryptic species resulted in incongruent relationships between the dilution plate and real-time PCR data. We therefore sequenced the ITS region of a large number of P. irregulare isolates in order to determine the proportion that would be detected by the real-time PCR assay. The ability to quantify pathogen populations directly from soils using real-time PCR (calibrated with data on inoculum potential) will improve disease risk assessment and lead to a reduction in pesticide application.

However, recent studies have shown that breakdowns in one-to-one specificity are not rare (30-60\% of species depending on the locality). Combined with evidence of hybridization in some species, this led researchers to propose that a better evolutionary model was one of groups of genetically well-defined pollinators coevolving with groups of frequently hybridizing figs. Nevertheless, these recent studies still indicate that a majority of fig species have one or more host-specific pollinator. The extent to which specificity barriers in these species are leaky will have important consequences for the evolutionary process in Ficus. At Lambir Hills N.P., Sarawak, a single individual of Ficus acamptophylla has become recently isolated from conspecifics through clearance of its specialized habitat, but adjacent forest has a diverse fig flora, including 16 species with congeneric pollinators. Thus, when this individual flowered I was able to investigate the maintenance of its specificity barriers in the absence of competition from the normal pollinator. Only 1 percent of inflorescences were entered by a single pollinator species, which had very low reproductive success, and no viable seeds were produced. Nonpollinating wasps also failed to reproduce in any of the inflorescences. These results indicate the maintenance of strict specificity barriers in this fig individual.","Res Inst Human \& Nat, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1338; data\_collection\_article:R\o nsted N., Weiblen G., Cook J., Salamin N., Machado C., \& Savolainen V. 2005. 60 million years of co-divergence in the fig-wasp symbiosis.

Under the hypothesis that fruit traits have evolved in response to different sets of selective pressures by disparate types of seed dispersers (the dispersal syndromes hypothesis), we test for two dispersal syndromes, defined as groups of fruit traits that appear together more often than expected by chance. (1) Bird syndrome fruits are brightly colored and small, because birds have acute color vision, and commonly swallow fruits whole. (2) Mammal syndrome fruits are dull-colored and larger on average than bird syndrome fruits, because mammals do not rely heavily on visual cues for finding fruits, and can eat fruits piecemeal. If, instead, phylogenetic inertia determines the co-occurrence of fruit size and color, we will observe that specific combinations of size and color evolved in a small number of ancestral species. We performed a comparative analysis of fruit traits for 64 species of Ficus (Moraceae), based on a phylogeny we constructed using nuclear ribosomal DNA. Using a concentrated changes test and assuming fruit color is an independent variable, we found that small-sized fruits evolve on branches with red and purple figs, as predicted by the dispersal syndromes hypothesis. When using diameter as the independent variable, results vary with the combination of algorithms used, which is discussed in detail.

Disparity between some of the forms is so great that until molecular tools were used, some annelid lineages (for example, echiurids and pogonophorans) were not commonly recognized as belonging to the group. Although it is easy to assign annelids to a given family, understanding the deeper relationships within the group has been difficult. The main working hypothesis for annelid phylogeny is based on morphological cladistic analysis. However, the recent work using molecular tools has caused a revision of our view of annelid evolutionary history. For example, Scolecida and Palpata appear not to be natural groups, and the phylogenetic positions of some aberrant taxa (for example, Siboglinidae, Poeobius, Pisione) have been determined.

Unfortunately, our knowledge of the biology and evolution of most of these groups is limited. Typhloscolecidae and Lopadorhynchidae are two such examples of recognized families of holopelagic annelids about which little is known. Both groups have a limited number of known species (13 and 15, respectively) and are rarely discussed in the literature other than to note occurrence. Placing these groups in a phylogenetic context has been difficult due to their seemingly unique morphology, and, to the best of our knowledge, lack of molecular data. Nonetheless, previous authors have suspected that they are members of Phyllodocida and perhaps within Phyllodocidae. To test such hypotheses, we have employed nuclear 18S and 28S ribosomal data in both a Bayesian inference and a maximum-likelihood framework. The resultant topology indicates that typhloscolecids and lopadorhynchs are sister taxa nested within Phyllodocidae near another holopelagic taxon, alciopids. Whereas posterior probabilities strongly support this placement, an AU hypothesis testing approach and bootstrap values are more equivocal but both still strongly suggest Phyllodocidae affiliations.

Different fruiting body types include open (apothecia) or closed (perithecia, cleistothecia) forms, which have traditionally been used as key paradigms for ascomycete classification. Molecular phylogenies show that most fruiting body types have multiple phylogenetic origins within the phylum, and are not suitable for the circumscription of classes. One exception are perithecia that are restricted in non-lichenized fungi to the monophyletic class Sordariomycetes. However, lichenized fungi with perithecioid fruiting bodies were found to belong to three other classes unrelated to Sordariomycetes. One of these is Lecanoromycetes, which includes the bulk of lichenized fungi. To understand the evolution of perithecioid fruiting bodies in the mostly apotheciate Lecanoromycetes, we assembled a combined data set of nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal, and RPB1 DNA sequences, and traced the evolution of two morphological characters (fruiting body type and fruiting body development). We reconstructed ancestral character states using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Additionally, we tested for correlation of character changes in a combined Bayesian/maximum likelihood framework. The results suggest that perithecia have evolved in unrelated groups of lichen-forming fungi. Within Lecanoromycetes they have evolved independently several times from apotheciate ancestors. Further, our analyses support a correlation between the type of fruiting body and the type of ascoma ontogeny. The evolution of angiocarpous ascoma development in Lecanoromycetes is a pre-adaptation for the repeated gain of perithecia. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of a neotenic origin of perithecioid fruiting bodies in Lecanoromycetes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A shared derived character, the operculate ascus, supports the Pezizales as monophyletic, although functional opercula have been lost in certain taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within Pezizales were studied using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of partial SSU and LSU rDNA sequences from 100 taxa representing 82 genera and 13 of the 15 families currently recognized. Three primary lineages are identified that more or less correspond to the A, B and C lineages resolved in previous analyses using SSU rDNA: (A) Ascobolaceae and Pezizaceae; (B) Discinaceae-Morchellaceae and Helvellaceae-Tuberaceae; (C) Ascodesmidaceae, Glaziellaceae, Pyronemataceae, Sarcoscyphaceae and Sarcosomataceae. In contrast the monotypic Rhizinaceae and Caloscyphaceae are resolved as two independent lineages. Bayesian analyses support a relationship among Rhizina and two species of Psilopezia (Pyronemataceae). Only lineage C is highly supported. The B and C lineages form a strongly supported monophyletic group. None of these lineages corresponds to earlier proposed suborders. The A and B lineages are supported by certain morphological features (e.g. ascus bluing reaction in iodine, cytology of spores and paraphyses, septal pore structures and excipulum structure); these characters have been Subject to homoplasy. Lineage C is the largest and most heterogeneous, and no unifying morphological features support its recognition. The Pyronemataceae, in which almost half of the species in the order are found, is not monophyletic because the Ascodesmidaceae and Glaziellaceae are nested within it. The relationships among all families in the C lineage remain uncertain.

Sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) + 5.8S ribosomal subunit gene region were generated for 89 samples, and supplemented by beta-tubulin (BTUB) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (EF1) sequences for a subset of F. cucullata specimens. Phylogenetic, nonparametric permutation methods and coalescent analyses were used to assess population divergence and to estimate the extent and direction of migration among continents. Results Both F. cucullata and F. nivalis were monophyletic, supporting their morphology-based delimitation, and had high and moderately high intraspecific genetic diversity, respectively. Clades within each species contained specimens from both North America and Eurasia. We found only weak genetic differentiation among North American and Eurasian populations, and evidence for moderate to high transoceanic gene flow. Main conclusions Our results suggest that both F. cucullata and F. nivalis have been able to migrate over large distances in response to climatic fluctuations. The high genetic diversity observed in the Arctic indicates long-term survival at high latitudes, whereas the estimated migration rates and weak geographic population structure suggest a continuing long-distance gene flow between continents that has prevented pronounced genetic differentiation. The mode of long-distance dispersal is unknown, but wind dispersal of conidia and/or ascospores is probably important in the open arctic landscapes. The high genetic diversity and efficient long-distance dispersal capability of F. cucullata and F. nivalis suggest that these species, and perhaps other arctic lichens as well, will be able to track their potential niche in the changing Arctic.","[Geml, Jozsef] Leiden Univ, Netherlands Ctr Biodivers Nat, Natl Herbarium Netherlands, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Geml, Jozsef; Taylor, D.

Location The mountains of Europe (Alps, Balkans, Carpathians, Central Massif, Pyrenees, Scandinavian chain, Sudetes), and central European/southern Scandinavian lowlands. Methods As our model system we used Pulsatilla vernalis, a widely distributed European herbaceous plant occurring both in the high-mountain environments of the Alps and other European ranges and in lowlands north of these ranges up to Scandinavia. Based on a distribution-wide sampling of 61 populations, we estimated chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation along six regions using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs) (trnH-trnK, trnK-trnK, trnC-trnD, psbC-trnS, psaA-trnS, trnL-trnF) and further sequencing of trnL-trnF and trnH-psbA. In addition, 11 samples of other European species of Pulsatilla were sequenced to survey the genus-scale cpDNA variation. Results Eleven PCR-RFLP polymorphisms were detected in P. vernalis, revealing seven haplotypes. They formed two distinct genetic groups. Three haplotypes representing both groups dominated and were widely distributed across Europe, whereas the others were restricted to localized regions (central Alps, Tatras/Sudetes mountains) or single populations. Sequencing analysis confirmed the reliability of PCR-RFLPs and homology of haplotypes across their distribution. The chloroplast DNA variation across the section Pulsatilla was low, but P. vernalis did not share haplotypes with other species. Main conclusions The genetic distinctiveness of P. vernalis populations from the south-western Alps with respect to other Alpine populations, as well as the affinities between the former populations and those from the eastern Pyrenees, is demonstrated, thus providing support for the conclusions of previous studies. Glacial refugia in the Dolomites are also suggested. Isolation is inferred for the high-mountain populations from the Tatras and Sudetes; this is in contrast to the case for the Balkans, which harboured the common haplotype. Specific microsatellite variation indicates the occurrence of periglacial lowland refugia north of the Alps, acting as a source for the post-glacial colonization of Scandinavia. The presence of different fixed haplotypes in eastern and western Scandinavia, however, suggests independent post-glacial colonization of these two areas, with possible founder effects.","[Ronikier, Michal; Mirek, Zbigniew] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Bot, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland; [Ronikier, Michal; Kuepfer, Philippe] Univ Neuchatel, Lab Bot Evolut, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Costa, Andrea; Aguilar, Javier Fuertes; Feliner, Gonzalo Nieto]","; data\_id:S1352; data\_collection\_article:Alsos I., Engelskj\o n T., Gielly L., Taberlet P., \& Brochmann C. 2005.

It is a late-successional species of acidophilous alpine meadows that occurs on sites that were covered by ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM). By applying the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing, we attempted to identify the recolonization routes followed by the species after the last ice retreat. We relied on the genetic diversity of 37 populations covering the entire distributional range of the species. As a wind-pollinated species, C. curvula is characterized by a low level of population genetic differentiation. Nuclear and chloroplast data both support the hypothesis of a long-term separation of Eastern (Balkans and Carpathians) and Western (Alps and Pyrenees) lineages. In the Alps, a continuum of genetic depauperation from the east to the west may be related to a recolonization wave originating in the eastern-most parts of the chain, where the main glacial refugium was likely located. The Pyrenean populations are nested within the western Alps group and show a low level of genetic diversity, probably due to recent long-distance colonization. In contrast to the Alps, we found no phylogeographical structure in the Carpathians. The combination of reduced ice extension during the Wurm period and the presence of large areas of siliceous substrate at suitable elevation suggest that in contrast to populations in the Alps, the species in the Carpathians underwent a local vertical migration rather than extinction and recolonization over long distance.","[Puscas, M.; Choler, P.; Gielly, L.; Rioux, D.; Taberlet, P.] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR UJF 5553, CNRS, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Puscas, M.; Choler, P.; Gielly, L.; Rioux, D.; Taberlet, P.] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Stn Alpine J Fourier, UMS UJ","; data\_id:S1352; data\_collection\_article:Alsos I., Engelskj\o n T., Gielly L., Taberlet P., \& Brochmann C. 2005.

Whilst the genetic structure and post-glacial history of many high-mountain plant taxa of the Alps is relatively well documented, the Carpathian populations have often been neglected in phylogeographical studies. The aim of the present study is to compare the genetic variation of the species in two major European mountain systems - the Alps and the Carpathians. Locations Alps and Carpathians. Methods The genetic variation of 77 populations, each consisting of three plants, was studied using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Results Neighbour joining and principal coordinate analyses revealed three well-supported phylogeographical groups of populations corresponding to three disjunct geographical regions - the Alps and the western and south-eastern Carpathians. Moreover, two further clusters could be distinguished within the latter mountain range, one consisting of populations from the eastern Carpathians and the second consisting of populations from the southern Carpathians. Populations from the Apuseni Mountains had an intermediate position between the eastern and southern Carpathians. The genetic clustering of populations into four groups was also supported by an analysis of molecular variance, which showed that most genetic variation (almost 46\%) was found among these four groups. By far the highest within-population variation was found in the eastern Carpathians, followed by populations from the southern and western Carpathians. Generally, the populations from the Alps were considerably less variable and displayed substantially fewer region-diagnostic markers than those from the south-eastern Carpathians. Although no clear geographical structure was found within the Alps, based on neighbour joining or principal coordinate analyses, some trends were obvious: populations from the easternmost part were genetically more variable and, together with those from the south-western part, exhibited a higher proportion of rare AFLP fragments than populations in other areas. Moreover, the total number of AFLP fragments per population, the percentage of polymorphic loci and the proportion of rare AFLP fragments significantly decreased from east to west. Main conclusions Deep infraspecific phylogeographical gaps between the populations from the Alps and the western and south-eastern Carpathians suggest the survival of H. uniflora in three separate refugia during the last glaciation. Our AFLP data provide molecular evidence for a long-term geographical disjunction between the eastern and western Carpathians, previously suggested from the floristic composition at the end of 19th century. It is likely that Alpine populations survived the Last Glacial in the eastern part of the Alps, from where they rapidly colonized the rest of the Alps after the ice sheet retreated. Multiple founder effects may explain a gradual loss of genetic variation during westward colonization of the Alps.","Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR UJF 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1352; data\_collection\_article:Alsos I., Engelskj\o n T., Gielly L., Taberlet P., \& Brochmann C. 2005.

It has a wider distribution than most other arctic-alpine plants, covering all European mountain systems, the Canary Islands, North Africa, the high mountains of East Africa and Ethiopia, the Arabian Peninsula and mountain ranges of Central Asia in Iran and Iraq. Additionally it is found in the northern amphi-Atlantic area including northeastern North America, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard and northwestern Europe. We used markers from the nuclear (internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA) and chloroplast genome (trnL-F region) to reconstruct its phylogeographic history. Both markers revealed clear phylogeographic structure. We suggest that A. alpina originated in Asia Minor less than 2 million years ago based on synonymous mutation rates of different genes (plastidic matK, nuclear adh and chs). From the Asian ancestral stock one group migrated via the Arabian Peninsula to the East African high mountains. A second group gave rise to all European and northern populations, and also served as source for the northwest African populations. A third group, which is still centred in Asia, migrated independently southwards and came into secondary contact with the East African lineage in Ethiopia, resulting in high genetic diversity in this area. In the Mediterranean regions, the genetic diversity was relatively high with numerous unique haplotypes, but almost without geographic structure. In contrast, the populations in the northern amphi-Atlantic area were extremely depauperate, suggesting very recent (postglacial) expansion into this vast area from the south.","Univ Heidelberg, Inst Plant Sci, Div Biodivers \& Plant Systemat, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Univ Oslo, Nat Hist Museum, Natl Ctr Biosystemat, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway; Nat Hist Museum, Dept Bot, London SW7 5BD, England; Univ Osnabruck, Dept Biol, D-49069 Os","; data\_id:S1352; data\_collection\_article:Alsos I., Engelskj\o n T., Gielly L., Taberlet P., \& Brochmann C. 2005.

Two major clades (A and B) can be distinguished within the monophyletic Palola. A number of individuals in clade B bear rows of ventral eyespots in the posterior body region, typical for swarming P. viridis and probably a synapomorphy for clade B. No morphological synapomorphy was found for clade A. Haplotypes from divergent clades often co-occur in the same location. Some haplotypes are geographically widespread, in one case covering the entire east-west expansion of the tropical Pacific.

Location Antirrhinum is distributed primarily throughout the western Mediterranean, with 22 of 25 species in the Iberian Peninsula. Methods Plastid (83 trnS-trnG and 83 trnK-matK) and nuclear (87 ITS) sequences were obtained from 96 individuals representing 24 of the 25 Antirrhinum species. Sequences were analysed using maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony networking. Molecular clock estimates were obtained for plastid trnK-matK sequences using the penalized likelihood approach. Results Phylogenetic results gave limited support for monophyletic groups within Antirrhinum. Fifty-one plastid haplotypes were detected and 27 missing haplotypes inferred, which were all connected in a single, star-like network. A significant number of species shared both the same haplotypes and the same geographical areas, primarily in eastern Iberia. Furthermore, many species harboured populations with unrelated haplotypes from divergent haplotype clades. Plastid haplotype distribution, together with nucleotide additivity in 59 of the 86 nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences, is interpreted as evidence of extensive hybridization. Lineage divergence estimates indicated that differentiation within Antirrhinum post-dates the Miocene, when the Mediterranean climate was established. Main conclusions Incongruence between plastid sequences, nuclear sequences and taxonomic delimitation is interpreted as strong evidence of limited cladogenetic processes in Antirrhinum. Rather, extensive nucleotide additivities in ITS sequences in conjunction with haplotype and haplotype-clade distributions related to geographical areas support both recent and ancient hybridization. This geographical pattern of Antirrhinum speciation, particularly in eastern Iberia, is congruent with isolation-contact-isolation processes in the Pleistocene.","[Vargas, Pablo; Guzman, Beatriz; Amat, Elena] CSIC, E-28014 Madrid, Spain; [Carrio, Elena; Guemes, Jaime] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; MALDEN; COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","; data\_id:S1358; data\_collection\_article:Mcdade L., Daniel T., Kiel C., \& Vollesen K. 2005.

Taxa were smapled to cover the geographic distribution of Thunbergioideae and to include all subgenera of the largest genus Thunbergia. All other major lineages of Acanthaceas were sampled to test monophyly and intrafamilial position of Thunbergioideas. Both parsimony and Bayesian analyses support Thunbergioideae as monophyletic. The mangrove genus Avicennia is Consistently placed as sister to Thunbergioideae although with only moderate support. Thumbergia and Mendoncia are both monophyletic in all analyses, and Mendoncia is placed as sister to Thunbergia plus Pseudocalyx. Relationships within the two largest genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia are highly resolved and most branches are strongly supported. our results suggest that the existing morphology-based classification of Thunbergia partially holds, but needs revision. Based oil the phylogenetic relationships we found it likely that a twining habit is ancestral for the genus Thunbergia. The thecal awns, Characteristic for many species in the genus, have probably evolved from unicellular bristles.

To help understand the success of junipers in drier habitats, we studied hydraulic traits associated with their water stress resistance, including vulnerability to xylem cavitation, specific conductivity (K-S), tracheid diameter, conduit reinforcement, and wood density in stems and roots, as well as specific leaf area (SLA) of 14 species from the United States and the Caribbean. A new phylogeny based on DNA sequences tested the relationships between vulnerability to cavitation and other traits using both traditional cross-species correlations and independent contrast correlations. All species were moderately to highly resistant to water-stress-induced cavitation in both roots and shoots. We found strong phylogenetic support for two clades previously based on leaf margin serration (serrate and smooth). Species in the serrate clade were 34-39\% more resistant to xylem cavitation in stems and roots than were species in the smooth clade and had similar to 35\% lower K-S and 39\% lower SLA. Root and stem resistance to cavitation and SLA were all highly conserved traits. A high degree of conservation within clades suggests that hydraulic traits of Juniperus species strongly reflect phylogenetic history. The high resistance to cavitation observed may help explain the survival of junipers during recent extreme droughts in the southwestern United States and their expansion into and habitats across the western and central United States.","[Willson, Cynthia J.; Manos, Paul S.; Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm \& Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; ST LOUIS; PO BOX 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166-0299 USA","; data\_id:S1375; data\_collection\_article:Oh, S. and D.

Our previous investigation into the phylogenetic relationships of Chinese Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae, based exclusively on nrDNA ITS sequences, revealed several major clades heretofore unrecognized in the subfamily and confirmed the phylogenetic placements of five endemic genera. To further elucidate relationships among Chinese Apioideae, ascertain the phylogenetic placements of the remaining endemic genera, and test hypotheses of relationships proposed in our earlier study, additional taxa were examined for ITS and, for smaller sets of accessions, cpDNA rpl16 and rps16 intron sequence variation. These ITS and cpDNA data matrices comprised 158 and 131 accessions, respectively, with 110 accessions included in the analysis of combined ITS and cpDNA data. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of partitioned ITS and chloroplast data sets resulted in highly consistent phylogerries, whereas analyses of combined molecular data resulted in trees of greatest resolution and overall branch support. Two major clades identified in our previous study are recognized at the tribal level: Komarovieae J. Zhou \& S. R. Downie trib. nov. and Chamaesieae J. Zhou \& F. D. Pu trib. nov. The monotypic tribe Chamaesieae represents one of the earliest diverging lineages of subfamily Apioideae in Asia. The Acronema and East Asia clades of previous circumscription are each expanded. Of the five Chinese endemic genera not examined previously, Chaerophyllopsis finds affinity within tribe Scandiceae subtribe Scandicinae, Chuanminshen allies with Changium and Cyclorhiza in tribe Komarovieae, Harrysmithia falls within the Acronema Clade, Melanosciadium embeds in Angelica in tribe Selineae, and Dickinsia is confirmed as a member of Apiaceae subfamily Azorelloideae. The cpDNA-based phylogenies are not sufficiently resolved in their distal portions to elucidate the tribal placement of the endemic genus Nothosmymium, whereas the ITS trees strongly indicate an affinity with tribe Pimpinelleae. The affinities of several Chinese endemic species are also addressed. Peucedanum delavayi, for example, is phylogenetically distant from Sinodielsia and Meeboldia, genera with which it has been allied previously, and shows close affinity to three Chinese species of Ligusticum in tribe Selineae. Aside from providing a framework for taxonomic revisions, the phylogenetic structure recovered in this study for subfamily Apioideae will lay the foundation for future investigations of evolutionary patterns of morphological characters and biogeography.

Dieback of the shoots and cordon is believed to be due to acetylenic phenol metabolites produced by the fungus. To identify specific metabolites that could potentially be used for diagnosis of infection, eight E lata isolates were grown in vitro on hot water extracts from grape varieties with various degrees of tolerance to the foliar symptoms of E lata dieback. HPLC analysis showed that eutypinol was consistently produced in large amounts, together with smaller amounts of methyleutypinol and eulatachromene; eutypine, the putative toxin, was produced solely on Sauvignon Blanc extract and then in only barely detectable amounts. When E lata isolates from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot were grown on identical media, the amounts of metabolites produced differed significantly between isolates but the pattern of metabolites was quite similar, with eutypinol again predominating. The consistent production of eutypinol indicated that this was the most suitable metabolite for which to analyze in order to diagnose the presence of E lata. Extraction and analysis of grapevine tissues exhibiting symptoms of dieback failed to show the presence of any metabolites. However, when infected cordon sections were placed in water and cultured for 5 days, eutypinol was readily detected in the aqueous solution; metabolites were not produced from uninfected tissue. This provides a method for detection of infected tissue and indicates that the toxic metabolites react at the point of production, disrupting the vascular structure and inhibiting transport of nutrients, rather than being translocated to tissues that exhibit symptoms.","USDA, ARS, Western Reg Res Ctr, Albany, CA 94710 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Pathol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; WASHINGTON; 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","; data\_id:S1385; data\_collection\_article:Rolshausen P., Mahoney N., Molyneux R., \& Gubler W. 2005.

The islands are merely highpoints of an immense shallow continental shelf which during Pleistocene glacial periods was exposed periodically as dry land connecting the now isolated islands with one another. The area is home to a large number of primate taxa, including many endemic to the region (Nasalis, Presbytis, Pongo, Symphalangus, Simias, Tarsius). Worldwide, the number of described (extant) species of primates has doubled in the last two decades partially as a result of applying a different species concept (viz. Phylogenetic Species Concept PSC as opposed to the Biological Species Concept BSC). According to Isaac et al. (Trends in Ecology and Evolution 19: 464-469, 2004) this 'taxonomic inflation' will influence the outcome of macroecological studies. We studied the species-area relationships in Primates on 118 islands in insular Southeast Asia, and used two taxonomies (PSC and BSC). The number of primate species (PSC 37 species, BSC 23 species) is highly significantly related to surface area of the islands, and the slope of the curve is similar for both PSC and BSC species (z = 0.13). Species 'newly' described under the PSC are not only from large islands but also smaller ones hence affecting neither intercept nor the slope of the curve. Area alone was a much better predictor for primate species richness than models that included other macroecological variables (latitude, longitude, altitude, distance to mainland, greatest depth between island and mainland, distance to neighbouring islands). Degree of isolation has little influence on species number but both longitude and latitude are inversely correlated with the number of species per island, suggesting that species numbers decrease in a northerly and easterly direction. The low z-values suggest that for primates the islands of Southeast Asia are perhaps less isolated than previously recognised.","[Nijman, Vincent] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Social Sci \& Law, Dept Geog \& Anthropol, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Nijman, Vincent] Univ Amsterdam, Zool Museum, NL-1092 AD Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Meijaard, Erik] Indonesia Forest Program, Balikpapan 76112, Eas","; data\_id:S1389; data\_collection\_article:Poux C., Chevret P., Huchon D., Jong W., \& Douzery E. 2005.

Species identification is therefore largely based on secondary chemistry. We investigated different chemotypes of the morphologically highly similar L. jackii species complex by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. In phylogenetic analyses including all available Lepraria species, samples belonging to different chemotypes of the L. jackii agg. corresponded to four highly divergent clusters. While true L. jackii was genetically uniform, the other three clades represented previously unrecognized species. They originated from different major speciation events, and two of them were not closely related to any other species. Assessment of intraspecific genetic variability revealed four different patterns with respect to geographic scale. ITS sequences proved to be the most reliable and distinctive characters for species recognition in the Lepraria jackii complex and were in accordance with chemical and ecogeographic data. Frequent occurrence of long branches, relatively few resolved relationships despite high genetic variability, and the discovery and description of a considerable part of the Lepraria species within the last 10 years suggest that the genus is probably much larger than currently known.

Cophylogenetic comparisons based on nucleotide substitutions in the mitochondrial COI gene reveal a significant, but not perfect, pattern of cophylogeny between heteromyids and their sucking lice. Regression analyses show a significant functional relationship between the lengths of analogous branches in the host and parasite trees, indicating that divergence events in hosts and parasites were approximately contemporaneous. Thus, the topological similarity observed between heteromyids and their lice is the result of codivergence. These analyses also show that the COI gene in lice is evolving two to three times faster than the same gene in their hosts ( similar to the results of studies of other lice and their vertebrate hosts) and that divergence events in lice occurred shortly after host divergence. We recommend that future studies of codivergence include temporal comparisons and, when possible, use the same molecular marker(s) in hosts and parasites to achieve the greatest insight into the history of the host-parasite relationship.","[Light, Jessica E.; Hafner, Mark S.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci \& Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Light, Jessica E.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; PHILADELPHIA; 325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELP","; data\_id:S1413; data\_collection\_article:Huyse, T. and F.A.M.

A total of 1097 fish representing 14 species were collected during spring and summer of 2 consecutive years. A total spectrum of 40 parasite species was found, of which copepods and trematodes were the commonest. Congeneric fish species had the highest similarities in their parasite communities. Based on a cluster analysis, using only some fish species, no group was distinguished using abundance or prevalence of parasites, because 50\% of parasite species had high host specificity and only few of them were shared among fish species. Adult parasites showed high host specificity and were found mainly in resident intertidal fish, whereas the temporal fish had parasites with different degrees of specificity. Consequently, resident intertidal fish were characterized by their own parasite species, meaning that their transmissions might be restricted to the intertidal zone.","[Munoz, G.; Cortes, Y.] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias Mar \& Recursos Nat, Renaca, Vina Del Mar, Chile; NEW YORK; 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","; data\_id:S1413; data\_collection\_article:Huyse, T. and F.A.M.

We have found that during early ontogeny in Atlantic salmon stepwise changes occur in the configuration of the collagen fibre-winding of the notochord sheath. The sheath consists of a basal lamina, a layer of type II collagen, and an elastica externa that delimits the notochord; and these constituents are secreted in a specific order. Initially, the collagen fibrils are circumferentially arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, and this specific spatial fibril configuration is maintained until hatching when the collagen becomes reorganized into distinct layers or lamellae. Within each lamella, fibrils are parallel to each other, forming helices around the longitudinal axis of the notochord, with a tangent angle of 75-80 degrees to the cranio-caudal axis. The helical geometry shifts between adjacent lamellae, forming enantiomorphous left- and right-handed coils, respectively, thus enforcing the sheath. The observed changes in the fibre-winding configuration may reflect adaptation of the notochord to functional demands related to stage in ontogeny. When the vertebral bodies initially form as chordacentra, the collagen lamellae of the sheath in the vertebral region are fixed by the deposition of minerals; in the intervertebral region, however, they represent a pre-adaptation providing torsional stability to the intervertebral joint. Hence, these modifications of the sheath transform the notochord per se into a functional vertebral column. The elastica externa, encasing the notochord, has serrated surfaces, connected inward to the type II collagen of the sheath, and outward to type I collagen of the mesenchymal connective tissue surrounding the notochord. In a similar manner, the collagen matrix of the neural and haemal arch cartilages is tightly anchored to the outward surface of the elastic membrane. Hence, the elastic membrane may serve as an interface between the notochord and the adjacent structures, with an essential function related to transmission of tensile forces from the musculature. The interconnection between the notochord and the myosepta is discussed in relation to function and to evolution of the arches and the vertebra. Contrary to current understanding, this study also shows that notochord vacuolization does not result in an increased elongation of the embryo, which agrees with the circular arrangement of type II collagen that probably only enables a restricted increase in girth upon vacuolization, not aiding elongation. As the vacuolization occurs during the egg stage, this type of collagen disposition, in combination with an elastica externa, also probably facilitates flexibility and curling of the embryo.","Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; Univ Cambridge, Dept Anat, Cambridge, England; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1419; data\_collection\_article:Rychel A., Smith S., Shimamoto H., \& Swalla B. 2005.

The results show that the stromal photosynthetic functions were more ROS sensitive than the membrane-located reactions. The rbcL over-expression compensated for the damage only at 10 mu M Cu, whereas the genetic stimulation of alpha-tocopherol biosynthesis led to the protection of membrane reactions up to 50-100 mu M Cu. For this reason, the gradual growth drop of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures observed under increasing Cu2+ concentrations matched better with the loss of photosynthetic capacity than with those of photosynthetic quantum yields.

Their semi-autonomy is ensured by the essential replicase gene repC as well as the repAB partitioning cassette. While conserved repAB modules are widespread among bacterial plasmids and homologues are even responsible for chromosome partitioning, repC genes are exclusively present in Alphaproteobacteria. RepABC operons contain two strong incompatibility regions, namely a small regulative antisense RNA gene (inc alpha) and a palindromic centromere region (inc beta), which were previously used to classify these replicons. The present survey pursued a complementary strategy essentially following the rationale that all plasmids identified from a single bacterium are per se compatible. We established a novel classification scheme for plasmids based on comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of repC, repA and repB genes. Our case study is focused on the Roseobacter clade (Rhodobacterales), one of the most successful lineages of the marine bacterioplankton. Its global significance was shown in several studies and the interest in these organisms is reflected by more than 40 upcoming genome projects. Based on phylogenetic RepC analyses we identified nine compatibility groups that are expected to stably coexist within the same cell. This prediction is supported by RepA and RepB phylogenies, moreover independent evidence is delivered by the group specificity of highly conserved palindromes (inc beta).","[Petersen, Jorn; Pradella, Silke] DSMZ Deutsch Sammlung Mikroorganismen \& Zellkultu, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany; [Brinkmann, Henner] Univ Montreal, Dept Biochim, Ctr Robert Cedergren, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; MALDEN; COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, M","; data\_id:S1430; data\_collection\_article:Brinkmann H., Giezen M., Zhou Y., Raucourt G., \& Philippe H. 2005.

Phylogenetic analyses of data sets with fewer than 10,000 aa positions, which can be prepared without large-scale sequencing (e. g., expressed sequence tag analyses), are practical in challenging various unresolved issues in eukaryotic evolution.

Phylogenetic methods are particularly promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition, the application of these methods to real data raises the problem of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict. Results: We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF) between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible as it can use any definition of ""agreement"" among trees. We evaluate the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT) for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring the tree of life. Conclusions: The ability of Prunier to take into account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily run on large datasets.","[Abby, Sophie S.; Tannier, Eric; Gouy, Manolo; Daubin, Vincent] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, INRA, Lab Biometrie \& Biol Evolut,UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; LONDON; 236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1430; data\_collection\_article:Brinkmann H., Giezen M., Zhou Y., Raucourt G., \& Philippe H. 2005.

Critical to plastid establishment was the transfer of endosymbiont genes to the host nucleus (i.e., endosymbiotic gene transfer [EGT]) [9, 10]. It has been postulated that plastid-derived EGT played a significant role in plant nuclear-genome evolution, with 18\% (or 4,500) of all nuclear genes in Arabidopsis thaliana having a cyanobacterial origin with about one-half of these recruited for nonplastid functions [11]. Here, we determine whether the level of cyanobacterial gene recruitment proposed for Arabidopsis is of the same magnitude in the algal sisters of plants by analyzing expressed-sequence tag (EST) data from the glaucophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa. Bioinformatic analysis of 3,576 Cyanophora nuclear genes shows that 10.8\% of these with significant database hits are of cyanobacterial origin and one-ninth of these have nonplastid functions. Our data indicate that unlike plants, early-diverging algal groups appear to retain a smaller number of endosymbiont genes in their nucleus, with only a minor proportion of these recruited for nonplastid functions.","Univ Iowa, Dept Biol Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J Carver Ctr Comparat Genom, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Northwestern Univ, Childrens Mem Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; CAMBRIDGE; 1100 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA","; data\_id:S1430; data\_collection\_article:Brinkmann H., Giezen M., Zhou Y., Raucourt G., \& Philippe H. 2005.

In addition to brute force, genome-wide analysis of alignments, rare genomic changes (RGCs) that are thought to comprise derived shared characters of individual clades are increasingly used in genome-wide phylogenetic studies. We propose a new type of RGCs designated RGC\_CAMs (after Conserved Amino acids-Multiple substitutions), which are inferred using a genome-scale analysis of protein and underlying nucleotide sequence alignments. The RGC\_CAM approach utilizes amino acid residues conserved in major eukaryotic lineages, with the exception of a few species comprising a putative clade, and selects for phylogenetic inference only those amino acid replacements that require 2 or 3 nucleotide substitutions, in order to reduce homoplasy. The RGC\_CAM analysis was combined with a procedure for rigorous statistical testing of competing phylogenetic hypotheses. The RGC\_CAM method is shown to be robust to branch length differences and taxon sampling. When applied to animal phylogeny, the RGC\_CAM approach strongly supports the coelomate clade that unites chordates with arthropods as opposed to the ecdysozoan (molting animals) clade. This conclusion runs against the view of animal evolution that is currently prevailing in the evo-devo community. The final solution to the coelomate-ecdysozoa controversy will require a much larger set of complete genome sequences representing diverse animal taxa. It is expected that RGC\_CAM and other RGC-based methods will be crucial for these future, definitive phylogenetic studies.","Natl Lib Med, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA; OXFORD; GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","; data\_id:S1430; data\_collection\_article:Brinkmann H., Giezen M., Zhou Y., Raucourt G., \& Philippe H. 2005.

Okamura and Neotrichocolea S. Hatt, are two water saccate liverwort genera endemic to East Asia whose systematic positions have been controversial. To address their phylogenetic positions and relationships within liverworts, two data sets were analyzed using maximum parasimony and maximum likelihood methods: (1) four genes (psbA, rps4, 26S and nad5) of 57 taxa, and (2) nine genes (ehloroplast small subunit [SSU], large subunit [LSU], atpB, rbel., psbA; nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S; mitochondrial nad5) of 24 taxa. All of our analyses suggested the sister relationship between Trichocoleopsis and Neotrichocolea, which is also supported by morpholical characters, such as a lobed leaf with ciliate margins, water seas, coelocaules, and interior capsule wall cells with thin walls. Traditional classification usually considered Trichocoleopsis and Neotrichocolea as members of Lepidolaenacease or Trichocoleaceae, whereas our our results strongly suggested that the Trichocoleopsis-Neotrichocolea clade allied with Plilidiaceae, which is supported by the similar cliate and lobed leaves. However, considering many differences between them such as in the perianth sporeling type, water sacs, and rhizoids, we support a family rank for the Neotrichocoleacae, containing Trichocoleopsis and neotrichocolea, as previously suggested by Inoue in 1974.","[Liu, Yang; Lia, Yu; Wang, Wei; Chen, Zhi-Duan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Stale Key Lab Systemat \& Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Davis, E.

Okamura, an endemic moss genus of eastern Asia, has traditionally been classified in Pterobryaceae or Meteoriaceae. However, recent molecular data has suggested that Meteoriella should be placed in Hylocomiaceae. To elucidate the systematic position of Meteoriella within Hypnales, we analyzed two DNA sequence datasets consisting of two regional (mt-nad5, cp-rps4) with 64 taxa, and five regions (mt-nad5, cp-rps-4 cp-rbcL, cp-trnL-F, nr-ITS2) with 27 taxa, using maximum parasimony and maximum likelihood methods. Analyses of the two datasets strongly supported Meteoriella as sister to Loeskeobryum, which has hitherto been included in the Hylocomiaceae. Although the evolution of Hypnales and the monophyly of Hylocomiaceae remain unresolved, a close relationship between Meteoriella and Hylocomiaceae is clear. Meteoriella shares some morphological characters with Meteoriaceae and Pterobryaceae, apprently owing to convergent evolution related to epiphytic growth. A reappraisal of morphological evidence reveals greater morphological similarity with Hylocomiaceae than previously recognized. The possible systematic position of Meteoriella with Hylocomiaceae is discussed. Loeskeobryum, rather than Orontobryum (suggested by earlier studies), shows the closest phylogenetic relationship with Meteoriella.","[Wang, Qinghua; Jia, Yu; Liu, Yang; Chen, Zhiduan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat \& Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; VIENNA; C/O UNIV VIENNA, INST BOTANY, RENNWEG 14, A-1030 VIENNA, AUSTRIA","; data\_id:S1512; data\_collection\_article:Liu Y., Jia Y., Wang W., Chen Z., \& Qiu Y. 2005.

This study aimed to develop and describe a new simple method for the determination of trans- and cis-resveratrol concentrations in aqueous solutions. Up to 300 mu M trans-resveratrol was dissolved in water by sonication for 2 h. Cis-resveratrol was obtained by exposing a 100-mu M trans-resveratrol aqueous solution to sunlight for 8 h, followed by HPLC separation and analysis by mass spectrometry (resveratrol oxidation products were absent). Accurate values for UV absorbance in water were epsilon(lambda max)=epsilon(304) (nm)=30 335 M(-1)cm(-1), epsilon(286) (nm)=23 400 M-1 cm(-1) for trans-resveratrol and epsilon(lambda max)=epsilon(304 nm)=14986 M-(1) cm(-1), epsilon(304 nm)=9515 M-1 cm(-1) for cis-resveratrol. These values allowed us to propose formulae to assess the trans-/cis-resveratrol ratio in water, using a simple and reliable UV-vis spectrophotometric method. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between our UV method and the commonly used HPLC method. All these data are transferable to 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer solutions, which could be particularly useful for cell Culture, ex vivo and in Vivo studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the relative performance of a number of algorithmic approaches for the delimitation of areas of endemism is investigated within the context of the Canary Islands flora, and areas of endemism within the Canary Islands archipelago are defined. The Canary Islands. A data matrix comprising the distributions of 609 endemic spermatophyte taxa (c. 90\% of the endemic flora) scored on a 10 x 10 km UTM grid was analysed using: (1) UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) clustering of Jaccard and Kulczynski similarity coefficient matrices, (2) parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), and (3) the program ndm (eNDeMism). The performance of each method was then determined by the extent to which the resulting areas of endemism met three criteria: (1) possession of two or more strict endemic taxa, (2) diagnosability, and (3) geographical contiguity. Each of the four methods resulted in substantially different sets of areas. ndm analysis resolved 17 areas of endemism consistent with all three criteria, and collectively these accounted for 59\% of all cells. In the hierarchical analyses none of the methods recovered more than eight areas of endemism, and the total coverage of cells ranged from 13\% to 33\% when the results were confined to intra-island areas of endemism. ndm outperforms hierarchical clustering methods in terms of both the number of intra-island areas of endemism delimited that meet the three evaluation criteria and the total coverage of those areas. ndm may also be considered preferable because it is non-hierarchical, incorporates spatial information into the delimitation of areas, and permits overlap between areas of endemism where there is evidence to support it. The results support the use of ndm as the most appropriate method currently available for the delimitation of areas of endemism. The areas of endemism identified by the ndm analysis are discussed.","[Carine, Mark A.; Humphries, Christopher J.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Bot, London SW7 5BD, England; [Guma, I.

Variations in Illite, chlorite, and kaolinite contents indicate a strong glacial-interglacial cyclicity, while changes in smectite content present a higher frequency cyclicity. The provenance analysis indicates a mixture of individual clay minerals from various sources surrounding the South China Sea. Smectite derived mainly from the Sunda shelf and its major source area of the Indonesian islands. Illite and chlorite originated mainly from the Mekong and Red rivers. Kaolinite was provided mainly by the Pearl River. Spectral analysis of the kaolinite/(illite+chlorite) ratio displays a strong eccentricity period of 100 ka, implying the ice sheet-forced winter monsoon evolution; whereas higher frequency changes in the smectite content show an ice sheet-forced obliquity period of 41 ka, and precession periods of 23 and 19 ka and a semi-precession period of 13 ka as well, implying the tropical-forced summer monsoon evolution. The winter monsoon evolution is generally in coherence with the glacial-interglacial cyclicity, with intensified winter monsoon winds during glacials and weakened winter monsoon winds during interglacials; whereas the summer monsoon evolution provides an almost linear response to the summer insolation of low latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, with strengthened summer monsoon during higher insolation and weakened summer monsoon during lower insolation. The result suggests that the high-latitude ice sheet and low-latitude tropical factor could drive the late Quaternary evolution of East Asian winter and summer monsoons, respectively, implying their diplex and self-contained forcing mechanism.","Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR, Lab IDES, F-91405 Orsay, France; BEIJING; 16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.693988; data\_collection\_article:Boulay, Sebastien; Colin, C; Trentesaux, A; Frank, Norbert; Liu, Z (2005): Sediment sources and East Asian monsoon intensity over the last 450 ky.

The calculating code was modified and adjusted for the thermodynamic-kinetic simulation of the passage of irreversible solution-rock reactions with time. The simulations were carried out for a simplified crustal vertical section of slow-spreading (Hess-type) ridges, which consist only of mantle peridotites (spinel harzburgites). The results of our simulations demonstrate that the degree of peridotite serpentinization under the effect of low-temperature seawater when the rocks are exposed at the seafloor surface remains very low even after 10000 years of interaction. Serpentinization becomes efficient only at temperatures of 130-150A degrees C at crustal depths of 3.5-4.5 km.

The preservation history of selected calcareous nannofossil species across the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary is presented together with late Eocene and Oligocene calcareous nannofossil biochronology. The astronomically calibrated timescale of Palike et al. (2006) is used here. Across the E/O boundary, placolith preservation is controlled by variation in carbonate content. Taxa less prone to dissolution are Reticulofenestra umbilicus, Coccolithus pelagicus, Ericsonia Formosa and Dictyococites bisectus, while Cyclicargolithus floridanus is more susceptible to dissolution. A biochronologic framework has been established for the following taxa: the highest occurrences (HO) of Discoaster barbadiensis (34.773 Ma), D. saipanensis (34.435 Ma), E. formosa (32.919 Ma), R. umbilicus (32.021 Ma), Sphenolithus predistentus (26.928 Ma), S. distentus (26.812 Ma), and S. ciperoensis (24.432 Ma), and the lowest occurrences (LO) of S. distentus (29.997 Ma) and S. ciperoensis (27.142 Ma). The first consistent appearance of Triquetrorhabdulus carinatus occurs at 26.556 Ma, while the onset of the peak interval of T carinatus was determined at 24.669 Ma. Biochronological comparisons are made with other sites from the Atlantic Ocean. A Triquetrorhabdulus morphotype, labeled as 7: aff. carinatus, was recorded for the first time in the studied sediments, and precedes the LO of 7: carinatus by similar to 0.7 Myr.

The seawater temperature for water depths ranging from 0-200 m was estimated from G. bulloides delta O-18 by using various paleotemperature equations. Out of several paleotemperature equations, the one given by Epstein and others (1953) provided the best-fit results. Similarly, the estimated seawater salinity was calculated using the seawater delta O-18 calculated from G. bulloides delta O-18, and measured seawater temperature taken from the Levitus database. A comparison of seawater salinity and temperature estimated from G. bulloides delta O-18, with the measured seawater salinity and temperature at different water depths, shows that the calcification depth of G. bulloides varies latitudinally. From the equator to similar to 15 degrees S, the calcification depth of G. bulloides was inferred to be similar to 75 m. Between similar to 15 degrees S and similar to 43 degrees S, the estimated seawater temperature matched well with the seawater temperature at similar to 200 m water depth, indicating that the G. bulloides calcification depth was comparatively deeper in this region. Farther south of similar to 43 degrees S, however, the calcification depth appears to be considerably shallower than in the northern part of the study area. The comparison also showed that irrespective of latitudinal region, the estimated seawater temperature matches well with the seawater temperature during the austral spring season suggesting that G. bulloides is abundant at that time. The findings will help in paleoclimatic reconstruction studies based on characteristics of G. bulloides.","[Saraswat, R.] Natl Inst Oceanog, Micropaleontol Lab, Panaji 403004, Goa, India; [Khare, N.] Minist Earth Sci, New Delhi 110003, India; CAMBRIDGE; MUSEUM COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY, DEPT INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY 26 OXFORD ST, HARVARD UNIV, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 U","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.738561; data\_collection\_article:Waelbroeck, Claire; Mulitza, Stefan; Spero, Howard; Dokken, Trond; Kiefer, Thorsten; Cortijo, Elsa (2005): A global compilation of Late Holocene planktonic foraminiferal d18O: Relationship between surface water temperature and d18O.

The MTCs were subdivided into detached and shelf-attached types. Relative timing of the detached MTC processes cannot be determined due to their local character. Four major shelf attached MTCs are described from interchannel low areas. We hypothesize that these attached MTCs began to be generated during a low stand of sea level (140-120 ka) which prompted hydrostatic pressure changes and/or gas hydrate dissolution on the slope, leading to collapse.

Six types of basins are recognized: perispreading, pericontinental, central thalassogenic, intermontane abyssal, interfault, and thalassosyneclise. The tectonic diversity of the basins and their systems reflects significant regional tectono-geodynamic features of the oceanic lithosphere. Basins of the first type are inherent to the Atlantic Ocean; of the second and third types, to the Indian Ocean; and of the fourth to sixth types, to the Pacific. In the Atlantic Ocean, the basins are spatially and paragenetically conjugated with the mid-oceanic ridge. Beyond the Atlantic, a similar situation is characteristic of the southern Indian Ocean only. Hence, differentiated energetic models of deep geospheres are required. The relations of potentially economic fields of ferromanganese nodules to tectonic types of abyssal basins are discussed. The largest fields with respect to both dimensions and reserves are confined to interfault and intermontane abyssal basins. The fields localized in central thalassogenic basins are second in importance. The perispreading and pericontinental basins are the least promising in this respect. Along with other criteria, tectonic analysis should be taken into consideration in the future development of these valuable mineral resources.","Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Moscow 119017, Russia; NEW YORK; 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA","; data\_id:10.1594/PANGAEA.745656; data\_collection\_article:Markov, YuD; Mozherovsky, AV; Pushkar, VS; Vashchenkova, NG; Nechaev, VP (2005): Sedimentation features and stratigraphic correlation of unconsolidated deposits from the Clarion Transform Fault Zone (Northeast Pacific).

Although some of these changes are virus specific,many appear to be common even among diverse viruses. Currently, little is known about the underlying molecular determinants. To identify gene expression changes that are concomitant with virus symptoms, we performed comparative expression profiling experiments on Nicotiana benthamiana leaves infected with one of three different fruit tree viruses that produce distinct symptoms: Plum pox potyvirus (PPV; leaf distortion and mosaic), Tomato ringspot nepovirus (ToRSV; tissue necrosis and general chlorosis), and Prunus necrotic ringspot ilarvirus (PNRSV; subtle chlorotic mottling). The numbers of statistically significant genes identified were consistent with the severity of the observed symptoms: 1,082 (ToRSV), 744 (PPV), and 89 (PNRSV). In all, 56 \% of the gene expression changes found in PPV-infected leaves also were altered by ToRSV, 87 \% of which changed in the same direction. Both PPV- and ToRSV-infected leaves showed widespread repression of genes associated with plastid functions. PPV uniquely induced the expression of large numbers of cytosolic ribosomal genes whereas ToRSV repressed the expression of plastidic ribosomal genes. How these and other observed expression changes might be associated with symptom development are discussed.","USDA ARS, Appalachian Fruit Res Stn, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; ST PAUL; 3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA","; data\_id:GSE1243; data\_collection\_article:Biehl A, Richly E, Noutsos C, Salamini F et al.

We therefore investigated if and to what extent developmental genes of the human pancreas are expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and precursor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and if this correlates or predicts response to treatment and overall survival. Material and Methods: Invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas [UICC pT3pN0 (n = 13) vs. pT3pN1 (n = 25)] and tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [5-fluorouracil (FU)/folic-acid and gemcitabine; UICC ypN0 (n = 7) vs. ypN1 (n = 6)] resected between 1997 and 2003 were characterized histochemically and immunohistochemically [pancreas duodenum homeobox 1 (PDX-1), Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH), Patched (Ptc) and Gli-1]. Gene distribution was compared with morphological patterns of the pancreatic carcinoma and PanIN as well as with peritumorous reactions of normal pancreas. Results: The overall expression of PDX-1, SHH, Ptc and Gli-1 was low, but showed a distinctive and topographic linkage inside pancreatic carcinomas as well as inside PanINs. Additionally, a topographic and significant association of these markers with nodal status (PDX-1, Ptc, Gli-1), tumor size (PDX-1, Gli-1) and R status (PDX-1) was found. After stratification with the strongest outcome predictor, grading, survival analysis revealed that Ptc expression in grade 2 and PDX-1 expression in grade 3 carcinomas are independent survival factors. Conclusions: Markers of pancreas development are reexpressed in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas and their expression is essentially associated with general clinical and pathological features such as survival or nodal status.

These â€œspheroidsâ€ù can be maintained at room temperature under oxygen- and nutrientdeprived conditions for extended periods of time (weeks) as well as converted back to viable proliferating monolayers. Herein it is shown that HEK293 spheroid arrest and recovery requires the co-activation of both NF-$\kappa$B and JNK, and chemical inhibition of either NF-$\kappa$B nuclear translocation or JNK phosphorylation leads to cell death. Cytokine profiling within the aggregates during the arrest and recovery process is suggestive that a cyclical cascade was in operation, leading to endogenous cytokine production of TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, and IL-8, thereby propagating the cellular stress signal within cells as well as throughout the aggregate. Cytokines exist in vivo as mixtures, yet tissue culture studies delineating how cells respond to these molecules are often performed using individual effectors added exogenously. Are the results obtained in these studies true representations of physiological responses? As HEK293 multicellular aggregates (spheroids) survive long term arrest by endogenous cytokine (TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$) and chemokine (IL-8) signaling, adherent monolayer cells were evaluated for their ability to provide a â€œspheroid signal responseâ€ù when exposed to TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$ and IL-8 individually, and in combination, at concentrations observed in the aggregates. The spheroid signal transduction response iii was only observed when all three cytokines were present, demonstrating that signal transduction cascade mechanisms are cytokine-profile dependent. To determine if similar processes were involved in the arrest and recovery of multicellular aggregates derived from other cell types, the responses of primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-2) and a glioblastoma cell line (T98G) were characterized, utilizing the procedures developed in the HEK293 study. Both the T98G and HFF-2 cell lines entered and exited from the long term arrest utilizing an autocrine response. However, while the carcinoma cell line was dependent upon NF-$\kappa$B for survival, its signaling partner was Gadd45$\alpha$ and signaling occurred through the p38 pathway. Primary fibroblast arrest and recovery proceeded through the p38 pathway as well, but was independent of NF-$\kappa$B. Thus, three different cell types and transformation states (HEK293, HFF-2, and T98G) provided three different routes to survival, all with cyclical cytokine production and signaling. These routes cannot be measured or modulated effectively in adherent monolayers. Multicellular aggregates provide higher ordered systems that can be used to describe signaling pathways within a cell, highlighting the role of autocrine responses and the synergistic relationships between cytokines and neighboring cells.",,"Jack GD, Garst JF, Cabrera MC, DeSantis AM et al.

Design and methods Myocardial infarction leading to heart failure was induced in rats, with animals killed 1, 3, 7,14, 42, and 92 days after coronary artery ligation. A second group was subjected to daily treadmill exercise and killed 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after a single exercise bout, or after 28 or 56 days of exercise training. Results Physiological hypertrophy was associated with less transcriptional alternation than pathological hypertrophy, indicating that posttranscriptional and translational regulation may be more important. The main difference between the two types of hypertrophy was that myocardial infarction was associated with downregulation of genes related to fatty acid metabolism, whereas no such change occurred after exercise training. Thus, fatty acid metabolism may distinguish adverse maladaptive hypertrophy from beneficial adaptive hypertrophy. Conclusion This study points to specific genes and gene classes related to biological processes that may be important in these well-characterized rat models of physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

The major component of this reflux is gastric acid. However, the impact of low pH on gene expression has not been extensively studied in oesophageal cells. This study utilizes a transcriptomic and bioinformatic approach to assess regulation of gene expression in response to low pH. In more detail, oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines were exposed to a range of pH environments. Affymetrix microarrays were used for gene-expression analysis and results were validated using cycle limitation and real-time RT-PCR analysis, as well as northern and western blotting. Comparative promoter transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis (MatInspector) of hierarchically clustered gene-expression data was employed to identify the elements which may co-ordinately regulate individual gene clusters. Initial experiments demonstrated maximal induction of EGR1 gene expression at pH 6.5. Subsequent array experimentation revealed significant induction of gene expression from such functional categories as DNA damage response (EGR1-4, ATF3) and cell-cycle control (GADD34, GADD45, p57). Changes in expression of EGR1, EGR3, ATF3, MKP-1, FOSB, CTGF and CYR61 were verified in separate experiments and in a variety of oesophageal cell lines. TFBS analysis of promoters identified transcription factors that may co-ordinately regulate gene-expression clusters, Cluster 1: Oct-1, AP4R; Cluster 2: NF-kB, EGRF; Cluster 3: IKRS, AP-1F. Low pH has the ability to induce genes and pathways which can provide an environment suitable for the progression of malignancy. Further functional analysis of the genes and clusters identified in this low pH study is likely to lead to new insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of GORD and oesophageal cancer.",,"Duggan SP, Gallagher WM, Fox EJ, Abdel-Latif MM et al.

Even with exhaustive investigation, however, there is still little understanding of the pathologic events that translate increased IOP into the process of retinal ganglion cell death. New studies, particularly in rat and mouse models of glaucoma, have helped elucidate some of the important events associated with the initiation of glaucoma. This review summarizes a 5-stage series hypothesizing that elevated IOP causes deleterious changes to glia in the optic nerve head (stage 1), which activate the autonomous self-destruction of ganglion cell axons (stage 2), leading to the loss of neurotrophic support and apoptotic death of ganglion cell somas in the retina (stage 3). In the initial wave of ganglion cell death, dying cells may, adversely affect their neighbouring cells in a wave of secondary degeneration involving glutamate exposure (stage 4). As ganglion cell structures disappear through the processes of cell death, glia are again involved, but this time to replace the lost neural tissue with a glial scar (stage 5).","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ophthalmol \& Visual Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; OTTAWA; 1525 CARLING AVE SUITE 610, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 8R9, CANADA","; data\_id:GSE2378; data\_collection\_article:Hernandez MR, Agapova OA, Yang P, Salvador-Silva M et al.

Moreover, very little is known about how interindividual genetic variation contributes to protein expression patterns. To begin to address this, we describe elements of technical and biological variations contributing to expression of 544 proteins in a population of 24 individual human lymphoblastoid cell lines that have been extensively genotyped as part of the International HapMap Project. We determined that expression levels of 10\% of the proteins were tightly correlated to cell doubling rates. Using the publicly available genotypes for these lymphoblastoid cell lines, we applied a genetic association approach to identify quantitative trait loci associated with protein expression variation. Results identified 24 protein forms corresponding to 15 proteins for which genetic elements were responsible for >50\% of the expression variation. The genetic variation associated with protein expression levels were located in cis with the gene coding for the transcript of the protein for 19 of these protein forms. Four of the genetic elements identified were coding non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms that resulted in migration pattern changes in the two-dimensional gel.

A deeper understanding of the molecular events underlying metastasis will provide information that will be useful for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The B16 and B16F10 mouse melanoma cell lines are widely used as model system for studying many aspects of cancer biology including metastasis. Compared with B16, which has a low metastatic potential, the highly metastatic cell line B16F10 displayed a higher metastatic ability along with higher expression levels of the metastasis-associated phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3). B16 cells transfected with PRL-3 cDNA (B16-PRL3) had metastatic abilities comparable to those of B16F10 cells. To study the molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis, the proteomes of the B16, B16F10, and B16-PRL3 cell lines were compared using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis. Proteins that varied significantly in levels between these cell lines were selected and identified using mass spectrometry. Interestingly, many proteins, especially those present in membrane fractions, were similarly up- or downregulated in both the B16F10 and B16-PRL3 cells lines compared to B16 cell lines. The list of similarly regulated proteins included heat shock protein 70, fascin-1, septin-6, ATP synthase P subunit, and bone morphogenic protein receptor type IB.

METHODOLOGY: We used a modified version of the Markov clustering algorithm to systematically extract clusters of co-regulated genes from hundreds of microarray datasets stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (n = 1,484). This approach led to the definition of 18,250 transcriptional signatures (TS) that were tested for functional enrichment using the DAVID knowledgebase. Over-representation of functional terms was found in a large proportion of these TS (84\%). We developed a JAVA application, TBrowser that comes with an open plug-in architecture and whose interface implements a highly sophisticated search engine supporting several Boolean operators (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/tbrowser/). User can search and analyze TS containing a list of identifiers (gene symbols or AffyIDs) or associated with a set of functional terms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As proof of principle, TBrowser was used to define breast cancer cell specific genes and to detect chromosomal abnormalities in tumors. Finally, taking advantage of our large collection of transcriptional signatures, we constructed a comprehensive map that summarizes gene-gene co-regulations observed through all the experiments performed on HGU133A Affymetrix platform.

In particular, expression of genes involved in N-glycan synthesis or in the modeling of chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans appeared to be modulated.

The deregulation of HOX genes is frequently associated with human reproductive system disorders. However, knowledge regarding the role of HOX genes in human granulosa cells is limited. Methods: To determine the role of HOXA7 in the regulation and associated mechanisms of cell proliferation in human granulosa cells, HOXA7 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressions were examined in primary granulosa cells (hGCs), an immortalized human granulosa cell line, SVOG, and a granulosa tumor cell line, KGN, by real-time PCR and Western blotting. To manipulate the expression of HOXA7, the HOXA7 specific siRNA was used to knockdown HOXA7 in KGN. Conversely, HOXA7 was overexpressed in SVOG by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-HOAX7 vector. Cell proliferation was measured by the MTT assay. Results: Our results show that HOXA7 and EGFR were overexpressed in KGN cells compared to hGCs and SVOG cells. Knockdown of HOXA7 in KGN cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and EGFR expression. Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells significantly promoted cell growth and EGFR expression. Moreover, the EGF-induced KGN proliferation was abrogated, and the activation of downstream signaling was diminished when HOXA7 was knocked down. Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells had an opposite effect. Conclusions: Our present study reveals a novel mechanistic role for HOXA7 in modulating granulosa cell proliferation via the regulation of EGFR. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the pro-proliferation effect of HOXA7 in granulosa cell growth and differentiation.","[Zhang, Yu; Huang, He-Feng; Leung, Peter C.

In the present work, two cell lines, MACL-1 and MGSO-3, were established from human primary breast cancer based on differential centrifugation, followed by growth in culture for over 70 passages. Characterization of the cell lines included morphology analysis, determination of doubling time, telomerase expression, tumor antigen expression, colony formation in soft agar, and xenograft implantation into nude mice. Morphological examination demonstrated a typical epithelial morphology and PCR analyses showed that both cell lines were telomerase positives. Moreover, MACL-1 and MGSO-3 were capable of growing in soft agar culture, which suggests its metastatic potential, and both demonstrated a positive tumorigenic potential in nude mice.

Two experiments used leaf morphological characters to identify putative hybrids. Intraspecific B. napus crosses produced low percentages (1.83\% and 1.79\%) of hybrid progeny. Brassica juncea x B. napus interspecific crosses produced on average 2.1\% hybrids, and the B. napus x B. juncea cross produced 0.2\% hybrids.

It is one of the crops covered by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and a breadfruit conservation strategy is being developed for the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Although an important staple crop in the Pacific with hundreds of recognized cultivars, breadfruit diversity is declining because of hurricane and drought damage and loss of cultural knowledge. Several ex situ collections were planted in the Pacific region in the 20th century, with materials widely exchanged. Provenance data are unavailable for most and those collections were neglected or abandoned. Actively managed breadfruit germplasm collections exist in Vanuatu, Samoa, the USDA National Plant Germplasm System, and the University of the West Indies (Trinidad and Jamaica). The National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii manages a field genebank of breadfruit species and cultivars with 220 accessions from 18 Pacific Island groups, the Philippines, the Seychelles, Indonesia and Honduras. Research on the NTBG collection includes chromosome counts, isozyme and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses, morphological descriptors, seasonality and yields as well as nutritional composition and fruit quality sensory evaluation for 20 cultivars. In vitro propagation research is underway to develop methods to conserve and exchange breadfruit germplasm. Making the numerous good-quality flavorful cultivars more widely available will provide nutritious food and trees for sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, home gardens and income generation.","Natl Trop Bot Garden, Breadfruit Inst, Kalaheo, HI 96741 USA; LEUVEN 1; PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM","; data\_id:S1261; data\_collection\_article:Zerega, N.J.C., D.

Results indicate that Diplococcium and morphologically similar genera, i.e. Spadicoides, Paliphora and Polyschema do not share a recent common ancestor. The type species of Diplococcium, D. spicatum is referred to Helotiales (Leotiomycetes). The placement of Spadicoides bina, the type of the genus, is unresolved but it is shown to be closely associated with Porosphaerella species, which are sister taxa to Coniochaetales (Sordariomycetes). Three Polyschema species analysed in this study represent a monophyletic lineage and are related to Lentithecium fluviatile and Leptosphaeria calvescens in Pleosporales (Dothideomycetes). DNA sequence analysis also suggests that Paliphora intermedia is a member of Chaetosphaeriaceae (Sordariomycetes). The type species of Bahusutrabeeja, B. dwaya, is phylogenetically related to Neodeightonia (=Botryosphaeria) subglobosa in Botryosphaeriales (Dothideomycetes). Monotypic genera Natarajania and Rattania are phylogenetically related to members of Diaporthales and Chaetosphaeriales, respectively. Future studies with extended gene datasets and type strains are required to resolve many novel but morphologically unexplainable phylogenetic scenarios revealed from this study. It is increasingly becoming evident that a fungal lineage may include a mosaic of anamorphs, teleomorphs and pleomorphs whose morphologies may not always be correlated. It is therefore suggested that where possible all new species descriptions, whether teleomorphic, anamorphic or pleomorphic, should include DNA sequence-data to facilitate amalgamation of anamorphic and pleomorphic genera in a single phylogenetic classification system.","[Shenoy, Belle Damodara; Amandeep, Kaur] Inst Microbial Technol CSIR, Microbial Type Culture Collect \& Gene Bank, Chandigarh 160036, India; [Jeewon, Rajesh] Univ Mauritius, Fac Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, Reduit, Mauritius; [Wang, Hongkai] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Bio","; data\_id:S1275; data\_collection\_article:Phillips A., Rumbos I., Alves A., \& Correia A. 2005.

The range of shape variation was characterised by wide rounded vs. tapered scales, and further by the extent of the dome area, and the secondary layer. Highly asymmetrical apical Mallomonas scales occurred only at low temperatures (10 and 15 degrees C). We also revealed a tendency for scale size to be reduced with increasing temperature; significant differences were found both in size of scales and in length of bristles or spines.

We present the first cladistic analysis sampling multiple representatives of most major groups based on DNA sequence for three nuclear (GHR, RAG1, and AP5) and one mitochondrial (COII and parts of COI and ATPase 8) fragments. Analyzed separately, the four partitions agree broadly with each other and the combined analysis. The basal split is between a clade of Philippine Old Endemics and all remaining murines. Within the latter, rapid radiation led to at least seven geographically distinct lineages, including a Southeast Asian Rattus clade; a diverse Australo-Papuan and Philippine clade; an African arvicanthine group including the otomyines; an African Praomys group; and three independent genera from Africa and Asia, Mus, Apodemus, and Malacomys. The murines appear to have originated in Southeast Asia and then rapidly expanded across all of the Old World. Both nuclear exons provide robust support at all levels. In contrast, the bootstrap proportions from mitochondrial data decline rapidly with increasing depth in the tree, together suggesting that nuclear genes may be more useful even for relatively recent divergences (< 10MYA).",,"Stoll, M., D.

After a quiescent period of about 16 years, some young biologists in New York and in New Zealand read Croizat's books and became enthusiastic supporters of his ideas. In New York, in the early 1970s, panbiogeography was combined with a part of Hennig's phylogenetic method to create vicariance biogeography. In 1986, the name of the latter was changed to cladistic biogeography. In the meantime, Croizat's followers in New Zealand sought to maintain panbiogeography in its original form without reference to phylogeny. This idea reached its peak of popularity in 1989-1990 and then began to fade. In comparison, cladistic biogeography became much more widespread, especially when its followers began publishing laudatory books and papers. Its decline became noticeable after the turn of the century as the dispersal counterrevolution began to have its effect. It served a useful purpose by engaging the interest of young biologists who otherwise may not have become aware of biogeography.","Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; NEW YORK; 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA","; data\_id:S1301; data\_collection\_article:Poux C., Madsen O., Marquard E., Vieites D., Jong W., \& Vences M. 2005.

Principal components analysis was employed to analyze 29 morphological characters of herbarium specimens from Australia, Madagascar, and Sumatra tentatively identified as C. australis and C. tagal, and two well differentiated distinct taxa were recognized. In addition, both of the detailed morphological features based on fresh and herbarium materials and the intron sequences of trnL gene from plastid DNA support this conclusion.

Recent analyses of rapidly evolving spacers and introns in the chloroplast genome from basal angiosperms show that extreme sequence variability is confined to certain mutational hotspots. These hotspots correlate with structural elements (stem loops). where selective pressure is low. Phylogenetic trees of basal angiosperms inferred from rapidly evolving genomic regions are well resolved and highly supported statistically. Reasons are not only greater amounts of informative sites in rapidly evolving DNA, but also differing levels of homoplasy that can result in better phylogenetic signal per informative site.

The results support an expanded concept for Australomimetus, which, apart from the introduced Ero aphana (Walckenaer, 1802), is found to contain the entire Australian and New Zealand mimetid fauna, also recorded from Asia. The following taxonomic changes are proposed: A. catulli (Heimer, 1989), comb. nov., A. hannemanni (Heimer, 1989), comb. nov., A. japonicus (Uyemura, 1938), comb. nov., A. mendicus (O. P.

To date, Botryosphaeria rhodina has been the only species associated with cankers on Vitis vinifera in California. A field survey of 166 vineyards in 21 counties was conducted in order to determine the occurrence of other Botryosphaeria spp. in California. In all, 1,735 samples of cankered trunks, cordons, and spurs were collected. Botryosphaeria spp. were the most common fungi isolated from grapevine cankers in California. Morphological identification along with phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and a partial sequence of the beta-tubulin gene showed that at least seven Botryosphaeria spp. occur on grapevines in California: B. australis, B. dothidea, B. lutea, B. obtusa, B. parva, B. rhodina, and B. stevensii. Botryosphaeria spp. were found in grapevine cankers in all grape-growing regions surveyed in California, whereas incidence and distribution varied with location. Grapevine cankers in California have been associated mainly with Eutypa dieback. However, the frequent recovery of Botryosphaeria spp. from cankers in this study indicates that the role of these fungi in grapevine health needs to be more carefully considered.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Pathol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, Madera, CA 93637 USA; ST PAUL; 3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121 USA","; data\_id:S1351; data\_collection\_article:Luque, J., S.

The systematic position of the remaining species is mostly unsettled but anticipated to represent several unrelated lineages within Lecanoromycetes. This study attempts to elucidate phylogenetic placement of members of this heterogeneous group of lichen-forming fungi, and to improve the classification and phylogeny of Lecanoromycetes. Twenty-five taxa of Lecidea sensu lato and 22 putatively allied species were studied in a broad selection of 268 taxa, representing 48 families of Lecanoromycetes. Six loci, including four ribosomal and two protein-coding genes for 315- and 209-OTU data sets were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. The resulting well-supported phylogenetic relationships within Lecanoromycetes are in agreement with published phylogenies, but the addition of new taxa revealed putative re-delimitations of several families, e.g., Catillariaceae, Lecanoraceae, Lecideaceae, Megalariaceae, Pilocarpaceae, and Ramalinaceae. As expected, species of Lecidea sensu lato and putatively related taxa are scattered within Lecanoromycetidae and beyond, with several species nested in Lecanoraceae and Pilocarpaceae, and others placed outside currently recognized families in Lecanorales, and orders in Lecanoromycetidae. The phylogenetic affiliations of Schaereria and Strangospora are outside Lecanoromycetidae, probably with Ostropomycetidae. All species referred to as Lecidea sensu strictu based on morphology (including the type species, Lecidea fuscoatra [L.] Ach.) form, with Porpidia species, a monophyletic group with high posterior probability outside Lecanorales, Peltigerales, and Teloschistales, in Lecanoromycetidae, supporting the recognition of the order Lecideales Vain. in this subclass. The genus name Lecidea must be redefined to apply only to Lecidea sensu stricto and to include at least some members of the genus Porpidia.

These consecutive gene blocks, consisting of several regions, are widely applied in plant phylogenetics. The regions coding for the subunits of the rRNA have the lowest rate of evolution. Also the spacer regions like the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and external transcribed spacers (ETS) are widely utilized in phylogenetics. The fact, that these regions are present in many copies in the plant genome is an advantage for laboratory practice but might be problem for phylogenetic analysis. Beside routine usage, the rDNA regions provide the great potential to study complex evolutionary mechanisms, such as reticulate events or array duplications. The understanding of these processes is based on the observation that the multiple copies of rDNA regions are homogenized through concerted evolution. This phenomenon results to paralogous copies, which can be misleading when incorporated in phylogenetic analyses. The fact that non-functional copies or pseudogenes can coexist with ortholougues in a single individual certainly makes also the analysis difficult.

In the taxonomic congruence approach, the measurement of reliability has been implemented by various consensus or supertree methods, but was seldom explicitly discussed as such. We explore a reliability index for clades using their repetition across independent data sets. All possible combinations of the elementary data sets are used to compose the sets of independent data sets, across which the repetitions are counted. The more a clade occurs across such independent combinations, the higher its index. However, if other repeated clades occur that are incompatible with that clade, its index is decreased to take into account the uncertainty resulting from conflicting hypotheses. Results can be summarized through a greedy consensus tree in which clades appear according to their repetition indices. This index is tested on a 73 acanthomorph taxa data set composed of five independent molecular markers and multiple combinations of them. On this particular application, we confirm that reliability as defined here and robustness (estimated by bootstrap proportions obtained from a 'total evidence' approach) should be clearly distinguished.","[Li, Blaise] Univ Paris 06, UMR 7138, F-75005 Paris, France; [Lecointre, Guillaume] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat \& Evolut, Equipe Phylogenie, UMR Systemat Adaptat Evolut 7138, F-75231 Paris 05, France; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OX","; data\_id:S1388; data\_collection\_article:Lartillot, N. and H.

Evolutionary relationships within the ecdysozoans remain, however, unresolved, impairing the correct interpretation of comparative genomic studies. In particular, the affinities of the three Panarthropoda phyla (Arthropoda, Onychophora, and Tardigrada) and the position of Myriapoda within Arthropoda (Mandibulata vs. Myriochelata hypothesis) are among the most contentious issues in animal phylogenetics. To elucidate these relationships, we have determined and analyzed complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences of two Tardigrada, Hypsibius dujardini and Thulinia sp. (the first genomes to date for this phylum); one Priapulida, Halicryptus spinulosus; and two Onychophora, Peripatoides sp. and Epiperipatus biolleyi; and a partial mitochondrial genome sequence of the Onychophora Euperipatoides kanagrensis. Tardigrada mitochondrial genomes resemble those of the arthropods in term of the gene order and strand asymmetry, whereas Onychophora genomes are characterized by numerous gene order rearrangements and strand asymmetry variations. In addition, Onychophora genomes are extremely enriched in A and T nucleotides, whereas Priapulida and Tardigrada are more balanced. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated amino acid coding sequences support a monophyletic origin of the Ecdysozoa and the position of Priapulida as the sister group of a monophyletic Panarthropoda (Tardigrada plus Onychophora plus Arthropoda). The position of Tardigrada is more problematic, most likely because of long branch attraction (LBA). However, experiments designed to reduce LBA suggest that the most likely placement of Tardigrada is as a sister group of Onychophora. The same analyses also recover monophyly of traditionally recognized arthropod lineages such as Arachnida and of the highly debated clade Mandibulata.","[Rota-Stabelli, Omar; Telford, Maximilian J.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut \& Environm, London, England; [Rota-Stabelli, Omar; Pisani, Davide] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Biol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Kayal, Ehsan; Lavrov, Dennis V.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol","; data\_id:S1388; data\_collection\_article:Lartillot, N. and H.

Sequence-based approaches have included studies of the total diversity of selected ecosystems, studies of the autecology of ecologically relevant species, and identification and enumeration of species of interest for human health. It is still uncommon, however, to delineate protistan species based on their genetic signatures. The reluctance to assign species-level designations based on DNA sequences is in part a consequence of the limited amount of sequence information presently available for many free-living microbial eukaryotes and in part a consequence of the problematic nature of and debate surrounding the microbial species concept. Despite the difficulties inherent in assigning species names to DNA sequences, there is a growing need to attach meaning to the burgeoning amount of sequence information entering the literature, and there is a growing desire to apply this information in ecological studies. We describe a computer-based tool that assigns DNA sequences from environmental databases to operational taxonomic units at approximately species-level distinctions. This approach provides a practical method for ecological studies of microbial eukaryotes (primarily protists) by enabling semiautomated analysis of large numbers of samples spanning great taxonomic breadth. Derivation of the algorithm was based on an analysis of complete small-subunit (18S) rRNA gene sequences and partial gene sequences obtained from the GenBank database for morphologically described protistan species. The program was tested using environmental 18S rRNA data sets for two oceanic ecosystems. A total of 388 operational taxonomic units were observed for 2,207 sequences obtained from samples collected in the western North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific oceans.","[Caron, David A.; Countway, Peter D.; Savai, Pratik; Schnetzer, Astrid; Moorthi, Stefanie D.; Jones, Adriane C.] Univ So Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gast, Rebecca J.; Dennett, Mark R.; Moran, Dawn M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods H","; data\_id:S1388; data\_collection\_article:Lartillot, N. and H.

Occasionally, however, some retroviruses can also infect and integrate into the genome of germ cells, which may allow for their vertical inheritance and fixation in a given species; a process known as endogenization. Lentiviruses, a group of mammalian retroviruses that includes HIV, are known to infect primates, ruminants, horses, and cats. Unlike many other retroviruses, these viruses have not been demonstrably successful at germline infiltration. Here, we report on the discovery of endogenous lentiviral insertions in seven species of Malagasy lemurs from two different genera-Cheirogaleus and Microcebus. Combining molecular clock analyses and cross-species screening of orthologous insertions, we show that the presence of this endogenous lentivirus in six species of Microcebus is the result of one endogenization event that occurred about 4.2 million years ago. In addition, we demonstrate that this lentivirus independently infiltrated the germline of Cheirogaleus and that the two endogenization events occurred quasi-simultaneously. Using multiple proviral copies, we derive and characterize an apparently full length and intact consensus for this lentivirus. These results provide evidence that lentiviruses have repeatedly infiltrated the germline of prosimian species and that primates have been exposed to lentiviruses for a much longer time than what can be inferred based on sequence comparison of circulating lentiviruses.

However, the growth conditions, e.g., nutrient availability and lack of a phenolics-rich organic layer, on ex-arable sandy soils differ markedly from those of heathland and will favor fast-growing plant species. Succession toward Calluna-dominated heathland is expected to take decades unless intensive restoration management is applied. Here, we report a possible mechanism to explain the occurrence of Calluna patches (0.7-2.0 m diameter) in a 10-year abandoned agricultural field within a dominant vegetation of grasses and forbs. All roots sampled from the Calluna patches were colonized by ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) and other endomycorrhizal fungi. Both nitrogen mineralization of soil organic N and potential nitrogen mineralization (arginine ammonification) were much lower in soil under Calluna patches than in the rest of the ex-arable soil, although other soil characteristics did not differ. The nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in Calluna shoots was much greater than that in shoots of grasses and forbs, indicating that the latter were more N limited. The results indicate that the association with ERM fungi is probably providing the host competitive superiority for nitrogen even in a soil with low organic matter content. Our results suggest that the conversion from arable land into heathland may be accomplished by the immediate establishment of Calluna seedlings and ERM inoculum when agricultural activities are stopped. This needs to be tested in controlled experiments.","[van der Wal, Annemieke; de Boer, Wietse; Gunnewiek, Paulien J. A.

While ordination of the DGGE data suggested that the assemblages did not differ significantly between the two plant taxa, T-RFLP data provided marginal statistical support for the presence of different assemblages. Fungi isolated from roots of both plants were identified by ITS sequence comparisons largely as ascomycetes, several of which had close sequence identity to Helotiales ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi. One isolate morphotype from E. pulchella had close sequence similarity to ectomycorrhizal fungi in the Cenococcum geophilum complex, and neighbour-joining analysis grouped this strongly with other Australian C. geophilum-like sequences. Distribution of genotypes of an ERM Helotiales ascomycete in root systems of the two plant taxa was also investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-PCR. Nineteen ISSR genotypes were identified, two of which were present in roots of both plant taxa.

Our results support a previous observation that eggplant is a particularly effective species for baiting H. chaetospira from soil and confirm the ability of this fungus to grow as an endophyte in the roots of axenically reared host plants. Cultural characters show that this species is similar to P. fortinii and other melanized fungi in the dark septate endophyte (DSE) group (e.g., Leptodontidium orchidicola, P. sphaeroides, and Cadophora finlandica) in that it produces darkly pigmented colonies on agar media. Heteroconium chaetospira differs from P. fortinii and other melanized members of the Leotiomycetes in the DSE group in that its conidia are fusiform and develop in blastic acropetal chains. Heteroconium chaetospira is phylogenetically distant from most DSE taxa because DNA sequences for the nuclear small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) indicate that the taxon is affiliated with the Herpotrichiellaceae of the Chaetothyriales rather than with the Leotiomycetes.",,"Hambleton, S., N.L.

Gene-specific fluorescent molecular beacons were designed for use with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Both methods were capable of detecting as few as one or two cells in 50 cycles. The species and gene specificities of the assays were evaluated using isolates (and mixtures) of P. parvum, related species, and out-groups. Cell counts using qPCR to evaluate environmental samples were comparable to mean values obtained from manual counts and had lower standard deviations.

One polymorphism that is only partially understood occurs in land snail species where individuals may coil clockwise or anti-clockwise. Theory shows that polymorphism in coiling direction should not persist yet species in several unrelated groups of land snails occur in stably polymorphic populations. A solution to this paradox may advance our understanding of evolution in general. Here, we examine two possible explanations: firstly, negative frequency-dependent selection due to predation; secondly, random Fixation of alternative coiling morphs in tree-sized demes, giving the impression of wider polymorphism. We test these hypotheses by investigating morph-clustering of empty shells at two spatial scales in Amphidromus martensi populations in northern Borneo: the spatial structure of snail populations is relatively easy to estimate and this information may support one or other of the hypotheses under test. For the smaller scale we make novel use of a statistic previously used in botanical studies (the K-function statistic), which allows clustering of more than one morph to be simultaneously investigated at a range of scales and which we have corrected for anisotropy. We believe this method could be of more general use to ecologists. The results show that consistent clustering or separation of morphs cannot be clearly detected at any spatial scale and that predation is not frequency-dependent. Alternative explanations that do not require strong spatial structuring of the Population may be needed, for instance ones involving a mechanism of selection actively maintaining the polymorphism.","Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England; Kinabatangan Orangutan Conservat Project, MY-90734 Sandakan, Malaysia; Univ Malaysia Sabah, Inst Trop Biol \& Conservat, MY-88999 Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; OXFORD; 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2D","; data\_id:S1567; data\_collection\_article:Schilthuizen, M., et al., Microgeographic snail shell evolution associated with behavioural divergence in their predator.
